<p>
Comrades,
<p>
Our main tasks at the present moment are those of the vanguard. At a time
when the great national Resistance War is making rapid progress, we need
a large number of activists to play the leading role [in it] and a large
number of vanguards to find the path. Vanguards must be frank, positive,
and upright people. They seek no self-interest, only national and social
emancipation. They fear no hardships, instead, in the face of hardship they
are determined and forever moving forward. Neither undisciplined nor fond
of limelight, they have their feet firmly on the ground and are realistic.
They are the guides on the road of revolution. In the light of the present
state of the war, if the Resistance is the concern only of the government
and armed forces, without the participation of the broad masses, we cannot
be certain that we shall win the final victory. We must now train a large
number of vanguards who will fight for our national liberation and can be
relied upon to lead and organize the masses for the fulfilment of this historic
mission. First of all, the numerous vanguards of the whole country must urgently
organize themselves. Our communist party is the vanguard of national liberation.
We must fight to the bitter end in order to accomplish our tasks.
<p>
Today we commemorate [ the death ] of Lu Hsun. We must first of all understand
him and his place in the history of our revolution. We commemorate him not
only because he was a distinguished writer but also because he, at the forefront
of national emancipation, dedicated all his strength to the revolutionary
struggle. (We commemorate him not only because he wrote well, becoming a
great literary figure, but also because he was a vanguard for national liberation
and gave tremendous help to the revolution. ) Although he did not belong
to the communist party organization, his thinking, action, and writing were
all Marxianized. He showed more and more youthful energy as his life drew
to its end. He fought consistently and incessantly against feudal forces
and imperialism. Under despicable circumstances of enemy pressure and
persecution, he struggled (suffered) and protested. In a similar way, Comrades,
you can also study revolutionary theories diligently while [living] under
such adverse material conditions [because] you are full of militant spirit.
The material arrangement of this school is poor, but here we have truth,
freedom, and a place to train revolutionary vanguards.
<p>
Lu Hsun emerged from the decaying feudal society. But he knew how to fight
back against the rotten society and the evil imperialist forces of which
he had had so much experience . He used his sardonic, humorous, and sharp
( powerful ) pen to depict the force(s) of the dark society (and of the ferocious
imperialists). He was really an accomplished 'painter'. In his last years
he fought for truth and freedom from the standpoint of the proletariat and
national liberation.
<p>
Lu Hsun's first characteristic was his political vision. He examined society
with both a microscope and a telescope, hence with precision and farsightedness.
As early as 1936 he pointed out the dangerous tendencies of the criminal
Trotskyites. Now the clarity and correctness of his judgement have been proved
beyond doubt by the facts&#151;the obvious fact that the Trotskyite faction
has turned into a traitorous organization subsidized by Japanese special
agents.
<p>
In my view, Lu Hsun is a great Chinese saint&#151;the saint of modern China,
just as Confucius was the saint of old China. For his immortal memory, we
have established the Lu Hsun Library and the Lu Hsun Teachers' Training School
in Yenan So that future generations may have a glimpse of his greatness.
<p>
His second characteristic was his militancy, which we mentioned a moment
ago. He was a great steadfast tree, not a blade of wavering grass, against
the onslaught of dark and violent forces. Once he saw a political destination
clearly he strove to reach it, never surrendering or compromising half way.
There have been half-hearted revolutionaries who fought at first but then
deserted the battlefield. Kautsky and Plekhanov of foreign countries (Russia)
were good examples [of this]. Such people are not infrequently found in China.
If I remember correctly, Lu Hsun once said that at first all [of them] were
'left' and revolutionary, but as soon as pressure came, [they] changed and
presented their comrades [to the enemy] as a gift. Lu Hsun bitterly hated
this sort of people. While fighting against them, he educated and disciplined
the young writers who followed him. He taught them to fight resolutely, to
be vanguards, and to find their own way .
<p>
His third characteristic was his readiness to sacrifice himself, completely
fearless of enemy intimidation and persecution and utterly unmoved by enemy
enticement. With merciless pungency his sword-like pen cut all those he despised.
Among the bloodstains of revolutionary fighters he showed his tenacious defiance
and marched ahead while calling [the others to follow him]. Lu Hsun was an
absolute realist, always uncompromising, always determined. In one of his
essays he maintained that one should [continue to] beat a dog after it had
fallen in water. If you did not, the dog wound jump up either to bite you
or at least to shake a lot of dirty water over you. Therefore the beating
had to be thorough. Lu Hsun did not entertain a speck of sentimentalism or
hypocrisy.
<p>
Now the mad dog, Japanese imperialism, had not been beaten in water yet.
We must learn this 'Lu Hsun spirit' and apply it to the whole country.
<p>
These characteristics are the components of the great 'Lu Hsun spirit'.
Throughout his life Lu Hsun never deviated from this spirit and that is why
he was an outstanding writer in the world of letters and a tough, excellent
vanguard in the revolutionary ranks. As we commemorate him, we must learn
his spirit. [We] must take it to all the units engaged in the Resistance
War and use it in the struggle for our national liberation.
