  LETTER TO COMRADE BROWDER

Dear Comrade Browder:
<p>
Taking advantage of the visit of a comrade, I am sending this letter to you,
honoured Comrade Browder, the good friend of the Chinese people and the leader
of the American people.
<p>
We have heard from several American comrades and from other quarters that
the American Communist Party and the great mass of the American people are
profoundly concerned about China's anti-Japanese struggle, and they have
already aided us in several ways. This gives us the feeling that our struggle
is not an isolated one, that we are receiving heroic assistance from abroad;
at the same time, we have the feeling that, when we obtain victory. this
victory will be of great assistance to the struggle of the American people
for liberation.
<p>
Today's world is on the eve of a great explosion, and the working class of
the whole world, as well as all the peoples seeking liberation, must certainly
unite and carry on a common struggle.
<p><em>
Revolutionary greetings!</em>
<P><em>
MAO TSE-TUNG</em>
<P>
24 June, 1937
