<h3>
7. The Strategy Of Guerrilla Resistance Against Japan
</h3>

<hr class="end" />

<p>
It has been definitely decided that in the strategy of our war against Japan,
guerrilla strategy must be auxiliary to fundamental orthodox methods. If
this were a small country, guerrilla activities could be carried out close
to the scene of operations of the regular army and directly complementary
to them. In such a case, there would be no question of guerrilla strategy
as such. Nor would the question arise if our country were as strong as Russia,
for example, and able speedily to eject an invader. The question exists because
China, a weak country of vast size, has today progressed to the point where
it has become possible to adopt the policy of a protracted war characterized
by guerrilla operations. Although these may at first glance seem to be abnormal
or heterodox, such is not actually the case.
</p>
<p>
Because Japanese military power is inadequate, much of the territory her
armies have overrun is without sufficient garrison troops. Under such
circumstances the primary functions of guerrillas are three: first, to conduct
a war on exterior lines, that is, in the rear of the enemy; second, to establish
bases, and, last, to extend the war areas. Thus, guerrilla participation
in the war is not merely a matter of purely local guerrilla tactics but involves
strategical considerations.
</p>
<p>
Such war, with its vast time and space factors, establishes a new military
process, the focal point of which is China today. The Japanese are apparently
attempting to recall a past that saw the Yuan extinguish the Sung and the
Ch'ing conquer the Ming; that witnessed the extension of the British Empire
to North America and India; that saw the Latins overrun Central and South
America. As far as China today is concerned, such dreams of conquest are
fantastic and without reality. Today's China is better equipped than was
the China of yesterday, and a new type of guerrilla hostilities is a part
of that equipment. If our enemy fails to take these facts into consideration
and makes too optimistic an estimate of the situation, he courts disaster.
</p>
<p>
Though the strategy of guerrillas is inseparable from war strategy as a whole,
the actual conduct of these hostilities differs from the conduct of orthodox
operations. Each type of warfare has methods peculiar to itself, and methods
suitable to regular warfare cannot be applied with success to the special
situations that confront guerrillas.
</p>
<p>
Before we treat the practical aspects of guerrilla war, it might be well
to recall the fundamental axiom of combat on which all military action is
based. This can be stated: 'Conservation of one's own strength; destruction
of enemy strength.' A military policy based on this axiom is consonant with
a national policy directed towards the building of a free and prosperous
Chinese state and the destruction of Japanese imperialism. It is in furtherance
of this policy that government applies in military strength. Is the sacrifice
demanded by war in conflict with the idea of self-preservation? Not at all.
The sacrifices demanded are necessary both to destroy the enemy and to preserve
ourselves; the sacrifice of a part of the people is necessary to preserve
the whole. All the considerations of military action are derived from this
axiom. Its application is as apparent in all tactical and strategical conceptions
as it is in the simple case of the soldier who shoots at his enemy from a
covered position.
</p>
<p>
All guerrilla units start from nothing and grow. What methods should we select
to ensure the conservation and development of our own strength and the
destruction of that of the enemy? The essential requirements are the
six listed below:
</p>
<p class="indentb">
    Retention of the initiative; alertness; carefully planned tactical attacks
    in a war of strategical defence; tactical speed in a war strategically
    protracted, tactical operations on exterior lines in a war conducts strategically
    on interior lines.
<br />
    Conduct of operations to complement those of the regular army.
<br />
    The establishment of bases.
<br />
    A clear understanding of the relationship that exits between the attack and
    the defence.
<br />
    The development of mobile operations.
<br />
    Correct command.
</p>
<p>
The enemy, though numerically weak, is strong in the quality of his troops
and their equipment; we, on the other hand, are strong numerically but weak
as to quality. These considerations have been taken into account in the
development of the policy of tactical offence, tactical speed, and tactical
operations on exterior lines in a war that, strategically speaking, is defensive
in character, protracted in nature, and conducted along interior lines. Our
strategy is based on these conceptions. They must be kept in mind in the
conduct of all operations.
</p>
<p>
Although the element of surprise is not absent in orthodox warfare, there
are fewer opportunities to apply it than there are during guerrilla hostilities.
In the latter, speed is essential. The movements of guerrilla troops must
be secret and of supernatural rapidity; the enemy must be taken unaware,
and the action entered speedily. There can be no procrastination in the execution
of plans; no assumption of a negative or passive defence; no great dispersion
of forces in many local engagements. The basic method is the attack in a
violent and deceptive form.
</p>
<p>
While there may be cases where the attack will extend over a period of several
days ( if that length of time in necessary to annihilate an enemy group ),
it is more profitable to launch and push an attack with maximum speed. The
tactics of defence have no place in the realm of guerrilla warfare. If a
delaying action is necessary, such places as defiles, river crossings, and
villages offer the most suitable conditions, for it is in such places that
the enemy's arrangements may be disrupted and he may be annihilated.
</p>
<p>
The enemy is much stronger than we are, and it is true that we can hinder,
distract, disperse, and destroy him only if we disperse our own forces. Although
guerrilla warfare is the warfare of such dispersed units, it is sometimes
desirable to concentrate in order to destroy an enemy. Thus, the principle
of concentration of force against a relatively weaker enemy is applicable
to guerrilla warfare.
</p>
<p>
We can prolong this struggle and make of it a protracted war only by gaining
positive and lightning-like tactical decisions; by employing our manpower
in proper concentrations and dispersions; and by operation on exterior lines
in order to surround and destroy our enemy. If we cannot surround whole armies,
we can at least partially destroy them, if we cannot kill the Japanese, we
can capture them. The total effect of many local successes will be to change
the relative strengths of the opposing forces. The destruction of Japan's
military power, combined with the international sympathy for China's cause
and the revolutionary tendencies evident in Japan, will be sufficient to
destroy Japanese imperialism.
</p>
<p>
We will next discuss initiative, alertness, and the matter of careful planning.
What is meant by initiative in warfare? In all battles and wars, a struggle
to gain and retain the initiative goes on between the opposing sides, for
it is the side that holds the initiative that has liberty of action. When
an army loses the initiative, it loses its liberty; its role becomes passive;
it faces the danger of defeat and destruction.
</p>
<p>
It is more difficult to obtain the initiative when defending on interior
lines than it is while attacking on exterior lines. This is what Japan is
doing. There are, however, several weak points as far as Japan is concerned.
One of these is lack of sufficient manpower for the task; another is her
cruelty to the inhabitants of conquered areas; a third is the underestimation
of Chinese strength, which has resulted in the differences between military
cliques, which, in turn, have been productive of many mistakes in the direction
of her military forces. For instance, she has been gradually compelled to
increase her manpower in China while, at the same time. the many arguments
over plans of operations and disposition of troops have resulted in the loss
of good opportunities for improvement of her strategical position. This explains
the fact that although the Japanese are frequently able to surround large
bodies of Chinese troops, they have never yet been able to capture more than
a few. The Japanese military machine is thus being weakened by insufficiency
of manpower, inadequacy of resources, the barbarism of her troops, and the
general stupidity that has characterized the conduct of operations. Her offensive
continues unabated, but because of the weaknesses pointed out, her attack
must be limited in extent. She can never conquer China. The day will come
&#151; indeed already has in some areas &#151; when she will be forced into
a passive role. When hostilities commenced, China was passive, but as we
enter the second phase of the war we find ourselves pursuing a strategy of
mobile warfare, with both guerrillas and regulars operating on exterior lines.
Thus, with each passing day, we seize some degree of initiative from the
Japanese.
</p>
<p>
The matter of initiative is especially serious for guerrilla forces, who
must face critical situations unknown to regular troops. The superiority
of the enemy and the lack of unity and experience within our own ranks may
be cited. Guerrillas can, however, gain the initiative if they keep in mind
the weak points of the enemy. Because of the enemy's insufficient manpower,
guerrillas can operate over vast territories, because he is a foreigner and
a barbarian, guerrillas can gain the confidence of millions of their countrymen;
because of the stupidity of enemy commanders, guerrillas can make full use
of their own cleverness. Both guerrillas and regulars must exploit these
enemy weaknesses while, at the same time, our own are remedied. Some of our
weaknesses are apparent only and are, in actuality, sources of strength.
For example, the very fact that most guerrilla groups are small makes it
desirable and advantageous for them to appear and disappear in the enemy's
rear. With such activities, the enemy is simply unable to cope. A similar
liberty of action can rarely be obtained by regular forces.
</p>
<p>
When the enemy attacks the guerrillas with more than one column, it is difficult
for the latter to retain the initiative. Any error, no matter how slight,
in the estimation of the situation is likely to result in forcing the guerrillas
into a passive role. They will then find themselves unable to beat oft the
attacks of the enemy.
</p>
<p>
It is apparent that we can gain and retain the initiative only by a correct
estimation of the situation and a proper arrangement of all military and
political factors. A too pessimistic estimate will operate to force us into
a passive position, with consequent loss of initiative; an overly optimistic
estimate, with its rash ordering of factors, will produce the same result.
</p>
<p>
No military leader is endowed by heaven with an ability to seize the initiative.
It is the intelligent leader who does so after a careful study and estimate
of the situation and arrangement of the military and political factors involved.
When a guerrilla unit, through either a poor estimate on the part of its
leader or pressure from the enemy, is forced into a passive position, its
first duty is to extricate itself. No method can be prescribed for this,
as the method to be employed will, in every case, depend on the situation.
One can, if necessary, run away. But there are times when the situation seems
hopeless and, in reality, is not so at all. It is at such times that the
good leader recognizes and seizes the moment when he can regain the lost
initiative.
</p>
<p>
Let us revert to alertness. To conduct one's troops with alertness is an
essential of guerrilla command. Leaders must realize that to operate alertly
is the most important factor in gaining the initiative and vital in its effect
of the relative situation that exists between our forces and those of the
enemy. Guerrilla commanders adjust their operations to the enemy situation,
to the terrain, and to prevailing local conditions. Leaders must be alert
to sense changes in these factors and make necessary modifications in troop
dispositions to accord with them. The leader must be like a fisherman, who<em>,
</em>with his nets, is able both to cast them and to pull them out in awareness
of the depth of the water, the strength of the current or the presence of
any obstructions that may foul them. As the fisherman controls his nets through
the lead ropes, so the guerrilla leader maintains contact with control over
his units. As the fisherman must change his position, so must the guerrilla
commander. Dispersion, concentration, constant change of position&#151;it
is in these ways that guerrillas employ, their strength.
</p>
<p>
In general, guerrilla units disperse to operate:
</p>
<p>
<p class="indentb">
    When the enemy is in over-extended defence, and sufficient force cannot be
    concentrated against him, guerrillas must disperse, harass him, and demoralize
    him.
<br />
    When encircled by the enemy, guerrillas disperse to withdraw.
<br />
    When the nature of the ground limits action, guerrillas disperse.
<br />
    When the availability of supplies limits action, they disperse.
<br />
    Guerrillas disperse in order to promote mass movements over a wide area.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Regardless of the circumstances that prevail at the time of dispersal, caution
must be exercised in certain matters:
</p>
<p>
<p class="indentb">
    A relatively large group should be retained as a central force. The remainder
    of the troops should not be divided into groups of absolutely equal size.
    In this way, the leader is in a position to deal with any circumstances that
    may arise.
<br />
    Each dispersed unit should have clear and definite responsibilities. Orders
    should specify a place to which to proceed, the time of proceeding, and the
    place, time, and method of assembly.
</p>
<p>
Guerrillas concentrate when the enemy is advancing upon them, and there is
opportunity to fall upon him and destroy him. Concentration may be desirable
when the enemy is on the defensive and guerrillas wish to destroy isolated
detachments in particular localities. By the term 'concentrate', we do not
mean the assembly of all manpower but rather of only that necessary for the
task. The remaining guerrillas are assigned missions of hindering and delaying
the enemy, of destroys isolated groups, or of conducting mass propaganda.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the dispersion and concentration of forces, the leader must
understand what is termed 'alert shifting'. When the enemy feels the danger
of guerrillas, he will generally send troops out to attack them. The guerrillas
must consider the situation and decide at what time and at what place they
wish to fight. If they find that they cannot fight, they must immediately
shift. Then the enemy may be destroyed piecemeal. For example; after a guerrilla
group has destroyed an enemy detachment at one place, it may be shifted to
another area to attack and destroy a second detachment. Sometimes, it will
not be profitable for a unit to become engaged in a certain area, and in
that case, it must move immediately.
</p>
<p>
When the situation is serious, the guerrilla must move with the fluidity
of water and the ease of the blowing wind. Their tactics must deceive, tempt,
and confuse the enemy. They must lead the enemy to believe that they will
attack him from the east and north, and they must then strike him from the
west and the south. They must strike, then rapidly disperse. They must move
at night.
</p>
<p>
Guerrilla initiative is expressed in dispersion, concentration, and the alert
shifting of forces. If guerrillas are stupid and obstinate, they will be
led to passive positions and severely damaged. Skill in conducting guerrilla
operations, however, lies not in merely understanding the things we have
discussed but rather in their actual application on the field of battle.
The quick intelligence that constantly watches the ever-changing situation
and is able to seize on the right moment for decisive action is found only
in keen and thoughtful observers.
</p>
<p>
Careful planning is necessary if victory is to be won in guerrilla war, and
those who fight without method do not understand the nature of guerrilla
action. A plan is necessary regardless of the size of the unit involved;
a prudent plan is as necessary in the case of the squad as in the case of
the regiment. The situation must be carefully studied, then an assignment
of duties made. Plans must include both political and military instruction;
the matter of supply and equipment, and the matter of co-operation with local
civilians. Without study of these factors, it is impossible either to seize
the initiative or to operate alertly. It is true that guerrillas can make
only limited plans, but even so, the factors we have mentioned must be
considered.
</p>
<p>
The initiative can be secured and retained only following a positive victory
that results from attack. The attack must be made on guerrilla initiative;
that is, guerrillas must not permit themselves to be maneuvered into a position
where they are robbed of initiative and where the decision to attack is forced
upon them. Any victory will result from careful planning and alert control.
Even in defence, all our efforts must be directed toward a resumption of
the attack, for it is only by attack that we can extinguish our enemies an
preserve ourselves. A defence or a withdrawal is entirely useless as far
as extinguishing our enemies is concerned and of only temporary value. as
far as the conservation of our forces is concerned. This principle is valid
both for guerrillas and regular troops. The differences are of degree only;
that is to say, in the manner of execution.
</p>
<p>
The relationship that exists between guerrilla and the orthodox forces is
important and must be appreciated. Generally speaking, there are types of
co-operation between guerrillas and orthodox groups. These are:
</p>
<p>
<p class="indentb">
<br />
    Strategical co-operation.
<br />
    Tactical co-operation.
<br />
    Battle co-operation.
</p>
<p>
Guerrillas who harass the enemy's rear installations and hinder his transport
are weakening him and encouraging the national spirit of resistance. They
are co-operating strategically. For example, the guerrillas in Manchuria
had no functions of strategical co-operation with orthodox forces until the
war in China started. Since that time, their faction of strategical co-operation
is evident, for if they can kill one enemy, make the enemy expend one round
of ammunition, or hinder one enemy group in its advance southward, our powers
of resistance here are proportionately increased. Such guerrilla action has
a positive action on the enemy nation and on its troops, while, at the same
time, it encourages our own countrymen. Another example of strategical
co-operation is furnished by the guerrillas who operate along the P'ing-Sui,
P'ing-Han, Chin-P'u, T'ung-Pu, and Cheng-T'ai railways. This co-operation
began when the invader attacked, continued during the period when he held
garrisoned cities in the areas, and was intensified when our regular forces
counter-attacked, in an effort to restore the lost territories.
</p>
<p>
As an example of tactical co-operation, we may cite the operations at Hsing-K'ou,
when guerrillas both north and south of Yeh Men destroyed the T'ung-P'u railway
and the motor roads near P'ing Hosing Pass and Yang Fang K'ou. A number of
small operating base were established, and organized guerrilla action in
Shansi complemented the activities of the regular forces both there and in
the defence of Honan. similarly, during the south Shantung campaign, guerrillas
in the five northern provinces co-operated with the army's operation on the
Hsuchow front.
</p>
<p>
Guerrilla commanders in rear areas and those in command of regiments assigned
to operate with orthodox units must co-operate in accordance with the situation.
It is their function to determine weak points in the enemy dispositions,
harass them, to disrupt their transport, and to undermine their morale, If
guerrilla action were independent, the results to be obtained from tactical
co-operation would be lost and those that result from strategical co-operation
greatly diminished. In order to accomplish their mission and improve the
degree of co-operation, guerrilla units must be equipped with some means
of rapid communication. For this purpose, two way radio sets are recommended.
</p>
<p>
Guerrilla forces in the immediate battle area are responsible for close
co-operation with regular forces, Their principal functions are to hinder
enemy transport to gather information, and to act as outposts and sentinels.
Even without precise instructions from the commander of the regular forces,
these missions, as well as any others that contribute to the general success,
should be assumed.
</p>
<p>
The problem of establishment of bases is of particular importance. This is
so because this war is a cruel and protracted struggle. The lost territories
can be restored only by a strategical counter-attack and this we cannot carry
out until the enemy is well into China. Consequently, some part of our country
&#151; or, indeed, most of it &#151; may be captured by the enemy and become his
rear area. It is our task to develop intensive guerrilla warfare over this
vast area and convert the enemy's rear into an additional front. Thus the
enemy will never be able to stop fighting. In order to subdue the occupied
territory, the enemy will have to become increasingly severe and oppressive.
</p>
<p>
A guerrilla base may be defined as an area, strategically located, in which
the guerrillas can carry out their duties of training, self-preservation
and development. Ability to fight a war without a rear area is a fundamental
characteristic of guerrilla action, but this does not mean that guerrilla
can exist and function over a long period of time without the development
of base areas. History shows us many example of peasant revolts that were
unsuccessful, and it is fanciful to believe that such movements, characterized
by banditry and brigandage, could succeed in this era of improved communications
and military equipment. Some guerrilla leaders seem to think that those qualities
are present in today's movement, and before such leaders can comprehend the
importance of base areas in the long-term war, their mind must be disabused
of this idea.
</p>
<p>
The subject of bases may be better understood if we consider:
<p class="indentb">
<br />
    The various categories of bases.
<br />
    Guerrilla areas and base areas.
<br />
    The establishment of bases.
<br />
    The development of bases.
</p>
<p>
Guerrilla bases may be classified according to their location as: first,
mountain bases; second, plains bases; and last, river, lake, and bay bases.
The advantages of bases in mountainous areas are evident. Those which are
now established are at Ch'ang P'o Chan, Wu Tai Shan, Taiheng Shan, Tai Shan,
Yen Shan, and Mao Shan. These bases are strongly protected. Similar bases
should be established in all enemy rear areas.
</p>
<p>
Plains country is generally not satisfactory for guerrilla operating bases,
but this does not mean that guerrilla warfare cannot flourish in such country
or that bases cannot be established there. The extent of guerrilla development
in Hopeh and west Shantung proves the opposite to be the case Whether we
can count on the use of these bases over long periods of time is questionable.
We can, however, establish small bases of a seasonal or temporary nature.
This we can do because our barbaric enemy simply does not have the manpower
to occupy all the areas he has overrun and because the population of China
is so numerous that a base can established anywhere. Seasonal bases in plains
country may be established in the winter when the rivers are frozen over,
and in the summer when the crops are growing. Temporary bases may be established
when the enemy is otherwise occupied. When the enemy advances, the guerrillas
who have established bases in the plains area are the first to engage him.
Upon their withdrawal into mountainous country, they should leave behind
them guerrilla groups dispersed over the entire area. Guerrillas shift from
base to base on the theory that they must be in one place one day and another
place the next.
</p>
<p>
There are many historical examples of the establishment of bases in river,
bay, and lake country, and this is one aspect of our activity that has so
far received little attention. Red guerrillas held out for many years in
the Hungtze Lake region. We should establish bases in the Hungtze and Tai
areas and along rivers and watercourses in territory controlled by the enemy
so as to deny him access to, and free use of, the water routes.
</p>
<p>
There is a difference between the terms base area and guerrilla area. An
area completely surrounded by territory occupied by the enemy is a 'base
area'. Wu Tai Shan, and Taiheng Shan are examples of base areas. On the other
hand, the area east and north of Wu Tai Shan (the Shansi-Hopeh-Chahar border
zone) is a guerrilla area. Such areas can be controlled by guerrillas only
while they actually physically occupy them. Upon their departure, control
reverts to a puppet pro-Japanese government. East Hopeh. for example, was
at first a guerrilla area rather than a base area. A puppet government functioned
there. Eventually, the people, organized and inspired by guerrillas from
the Wu Tai mountains, assisted in the transformation of this guerrilla area
into a real base area. Such a task is extremely difficult, for it is largely
dependent upon the degree to which the people can be inspired. In certain
garrisoned areas, such as the cities and zones contiguous to the railways,
the guerrillas see unable to drive the Japanese and puppets out. These areas
remain guerrilla areas. At other times, base areas might become guerrilla
areas due either to our own mistakes or to the activities of the enemy.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, in any given area in the war zone, any one or three situations
may develop: The area may remain in Chinese hands; it may be lost to the
Japanese and puppets or it may be divided between the combatants. Guerrilla
leaders should endeavour to see that either the first or the last of these
situations is assured.
</p>
<p>
Another point essential in the establishment of bases is the co-operation
that must exist between the armed guerrilla bands and the people. All our
strength must be used to spread the doctrine of armed resistance to Japan,
to arm the people, to organize self-defence units, and to train guerrilla
bands. This doctrine must be spread among the people, who must be organized
into anti-Japanese groups. Their political instincts must be sharpened and
their martial ardour increased If the workers, the farmers, the lovers of
liberty, the young men, the women, and the children are not organized, they
will never realize their own anti-Japanese power. Only the united strength
of the people can eliminate traitors, recover the measure of political power
that has been lost, and conserve and improve what we still retain.
</p>
<p>
We have already touched on geographic factors in our discussion of bases,
and we must also mention the economic aspects of the problem. What economic
policy should be adopted? Any such policy must offer reasonable protection
to commerce and business. We interpret 'reasonable protection' to mean the
people must contribute money in proportion to the money they have. Farmers
will be required to furnish a certain share of their crops to guerrilla troops.
Confiscation, except in the case of business run by traitors, is prohibited
.
</p>
<p>
Our activities must be extended over the entire periphery of the base area
if we wish to attack the enemy's bases and thus strengthen and develop our
own. This will afford us opportunity to organize, equip, and train the people,
thus furthering guerrilla policy as well as the national policy of protected
war. At times, we must emphasize the development and extension of base areas;
at other times, the organization, training, or equipment of the people.
</p>
<p>
Each guerrilla base will have its own peculiar problems of attack and defence.
In general, the enemy, in an endeavour to consolidate his gains, will attempt
to extinguish guerrilla bases by dispatching numerous bodies of troops over
a number of different routes. This must be anticipated and the encirclement
broken by counter-attacks As such enemy columns are without reserves, we
should plan on using our main forces to attack one of them by surprise and
devote our secondary effort to continual hindrance and harassment. At the
same time, other forces should isolate enemy garrison troops and operate
on their lines of supply and communication. When one column has been disposed
of, we may turn our attention to one of the others. In a base area as large
as Wu Tat Shan, for example, there are four or five military sub-divisions.
Guerrillas in these sub-divisions must co-operate to form a primary force
to counterattack the enemy, or the area from which he came, while a secondary
force harasses and hinders him.
</p>
<p>
After defeating the enemy in any area, we must take advantage of the period
he requires for reorganization to press home our attacks. we must not attack
an objective we are not certain of winning. We must confine our operations
to relatively small areas and destroy the enemy and traitors in those places.
</p>
<p>
When the inhabitants have been inspired, new volunteers accepted trained,
equipped, and organized, our operations may be extended to include cities
and lines of communication not strongly held. We may hold these at least
for temporary (if not for permanent ) periods. All these are our duties in
offensive strategy. Their object is to lengthen the period that the enemy
must remain on the defensive. Then our military activities and our organization
work among the masses of the people must be zealously expanded; and with
equal zeal, the strength of the enemy attacked and diminished. It is of great
importance that guerrilla units be rested and instructed. During such times
as the enemy is on the defensive, the troops may get some rest and instruction
may be carried out.
</p>
<p>
The development of mobile warfare is not only possible but essential. This
is the case because our current war is a desperate and protracted struggle.
If China were able to conquer the Japanese bandits speedily and to recover
her lost territories, there would there would be no question of long-term
war on a national scale. Hence there would no question of the relation of
guerrilla hostilities into mobile warfare of an orthodox nature, both the
quantity and quality of guerrilla must be improved. Primarily, more men must
join the armies; then the quality of equipment and standards of training
must be improved. Political training must be emphasized and our organization,
the technique of handling our weapons, our tactics &#151; all must be improved.
Our internal discipline must be strengthened. The soldiers must be educated
politically. There must be a gradual change from guerrilla formations to
orthodox regimental organization. The necessary bureaus and staffs, both
political and military, must be provided. At the same time, attention must
be paid to the creation of suitable supply, medical, and hygiene units. The
standards of equipment must be raised and types of weapons increased.
Communication equipment must not be forgotten. Orthodox standards of discipline
must be established.
</p>
<p>
Because guerrilla formations act independently and because they are the most
elementary of armed formations, command cannot be too highly centralized.
If it were, guerilla action would be too limited in scope. At the same time,
guerrilla activities, to be most effective, must be co-ordinated, not only
in so far as they themselves are concerned, but additionally with regular
troops operating in the same areas. This co-ordination is a function of the
war zone commander and his staff.
</p>
<p>
In guerrilla base areas, the command must be centralized for strategical
purposes and decentralized for tactical purposes. Centralized strategical
command takes care of the general management of all guerrilla units, their
co-ordination within war zones, and the general policy regarding guerrilla
base areas. Beyond this, centralization of command will result in interference
with subordinate units, as, naturally, the tactics to apply to concrete
situations can be determined only as these various situations arise. This
is true in orthodox warfare when communications between lower and higher
echelons break down. In a word, proper guerrilla policy will provide for
unified strategy and independent activity.
</p>
<p>
Each guerrilla area is divided into districts and these in turn are divided
into sub-districts. Each sub-division has its appointed commander, and while
general plans are made by higher commanders, the nature of actions is determined
by inferior commanders. The former may suggest the nature of the action to
be taken but cannot define it. Thus inferior groups heave more or less complete
local control.
