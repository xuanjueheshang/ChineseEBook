  THE ROLE OF THE MERCHANTS IN THE NATIONAL REVOLUTION

<P class="information">
[<I>Extracted from the article 'the Peking coup d'etat and the Merchants',
published in Hsiang-tao, nos. 31-2 (11 July, 1923).</I>] 
  <hr class="end" />
<p>
The present <I>coup d'etat</I> has roused the merchants, who have persistently
ignored politics, and has led them suddenly to look up and pay attention
to politics. This is most welcome news! .... The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce....
has published a declaration to the whole nation. The declaration says: 'We
venture to proclaim with sincerity to the Chinese and the foreigners that
from the fourteenth day of this month our people do not recognize any action
of Ts'ao K'un and Kao Ling-wei, following their usurpation of political power...
as qualified to represent the country&#133;.&#146;
<p>
At the same time the Chamber of Commerce resolved not to recognize the national
assembly, which 'cannot represent the people' s will', and resolved , moreover,
to organize a democratic committee as the organ for dealing positively with
the affairs of the nation. This action... may be regarded as the first gesture
of the merchants to intervene in politics and as a manifestation of the fact
that the merchants, who remained silent for three years, now speak in awesome
tones .
<p>
The present political problem in China is none other than the problem of
the national revolution <I>[kuomin ko-ming]. </I>To use the strength of the
people to overthrow the militarists and foreign imperialism, with which the
former are in collusion to accomplish their treasonable acts, is the historic
mission of the Chinese people. This revolution is the task of the people
as a whole. The merchants, workers, peasants, students, and teachers should
all come forward to take on the responsibility for a portion of the revolutionary
work; but because of historical necessity and current tendencies, the work
for which the merchants should be responsible in the national revolution
is both more urgent and more important than the work that the rest of the
people should take upon themselves. We know that the politics of semicolonial
China is characterized by the fact that the militarists and the foreign powers
have banded together to impose a twofold oppression on the people of the
whole country. The people of the whole country naturally suffer profoundly
under this kind of twofold oppression. Nevertheless, the merchants are the
ones who feel these sufferings most acutely and most urgently. Everybody
knows that the <I>likin</I><B><I> </I></B>and customs duties are matters
of life and death for the merchants. The pressing demands for the merchants
to 'abolish the <I>likin</I> and raise the tariffs' are the expression of
their most immediate interest. But abolishing the <I>likin</I> and raising
the tariffs is not something that can be easily done, because abolishing
the <I>likin</I> hurts the interests of the militarists and raising the tariffs
hurts the interest of foreign imperialism. If the <I>likin</I> were abolished
completely the militarists would grow thinner day by day, and the merchants
fatter. In that case, the merchants would need only to shout in order to
overthrow the militarists. But the clever militarists definitely will not
do such a foolish thing as to lift a stone in this way and crush their own
feet. And if one were to increase considerably the tariffs on foreign goods
or even go so far as to abolish the tariffs fixed by the treaties and replace
them by protective tariffs freely set by the Chinese themselves, thus removing
the fetters encumbering the Chinese merchants, the industry and commerce
of the country would develop rapidly and foreign goods would no longer be
able to gain a foothold in China. The cunning foreign imperialists are even
less likely to do such a foolish thing.... The positions of the foreign powers
and the militarists on the one hand and the merchants on the other are truly
incompatible..
<p>
The merchants have hitherto 'loved peace' and have never imagined the political
transformation necessitated a revolution which could not be accomplished
by a few telegrams in favour of 'the reduction of the number of soldiers,
the application of the constitution, and financial reforms'. Still less did
they imagine that revolution necessitated their personal participation, and
that only by calling for the organization of all the people and creating
a mass movement could a revolutionary force be brought into existence. They
even went so far as to think that political reform did not require a political
party and to call the revolutionary efforts of the Kuomintang superfluous.
It is impossible to compare these juvenile and timid attitudes with the present
situation without being convulsed with laughter.... Judging from the actions
of the Shanghai merchants in response to the <I>coup d'etat</I>, we know
that they have already changed their attitudes, cast away their pacifism,
adopted revolutionary methods, drummed up the courage to shoulder responsibility
for the affairs of the nation,. and progressed rapidly .....
<p>
The Shanghai merchants have arisen and begun to act. We hope that the merchants
outside of Shanghai will all rise up and act together. The present situation
is extremely pressing, as though the fire were already singeing our eyebrows,
and does not permit us to fall idly asleep once more. At present, we must
unite the whole nation in order to carry out the revolution. Factionalism
among the merchants cannot be tolerated. They must know that foreign powers
and the militarists are the common enemies of all the merchants, as well
as of the whole nation. Moreover, the advantages obtained after a successful
revolution will be common advantages. It is essential to unite and struggle
.so as to overthrow the common enemy and assure the common interest.... The
broader the organization of merchants, the greater will be their influence,
the greater will be their ability to lead the people of the whole country,
and the more rapid the success of the revolution!
<p>
In conclusion, we have the following warnings for the merchants of the whole
country: (1) The great cause of revolution is no easy matter, even less so
in China, a country under the twofold pressure of the foreign powers and
the militarists. The only solution is to call upon the merchants, the workers,
the peasants, the students, and the teachers of the whole country, as well
as all the others who constitute our nation and who suffer under a common
oppression, and to establish a closely knit united front. It is only then
that this revolution will succeed., .. We must no longer neglect the lesson
to be learned from previous experience, when the Association of Merchants
and Teachers refused participation of the workers. (2) Now that the merchants
have already courageously taken the first step in the revolution, they must
take the second step.... endeavour to move forward, and never stop until
they have attained their goal. Above all, they must never stop on meeting
a slight obstruction, or set out on the false path of making an agreement
with the foreign powers and the militarists. Everyone must believe that the
only way to save both himself and the nation is through the national revolution.
Many revolutionary causes throughout history may serve as our reference and
our guide. Circumstances call upon us to perform a historic task. We can
no longer be negligent! To open a new era through revolutionary methods,
and to build a new nation &#151; such is the historic mission of the Chinese
people. We must never forget it!
