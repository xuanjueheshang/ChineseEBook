Old Comrade Hsu,
<p>
You were my teacher twenty years ago; you are still my teacher; you will
continue to be my teacher in future. When the revolution failed and many
members left the party, even defecting to the enemy, you joined [the party]
in the autumn of 1927 and adopted an extremely active attitude. From then
until now you have shown through a long period of bitter struggle greater
positiveness, less fear of difficulty and more humility in learning new things
than many younger members of the party. 'Age', 'declining physical and mental
abilities', and 'hardships and obstacles' have all surrendered to you, in
spite of the fact that they have served as excuses for the timidity of many
people. You know a great deal but always feel a deficiency in your knowledge,
whereas many 'half-buckets of water' [people of superficial knowledge] make
a lot of noise. What you think is what you say or what you do, whereas other
people hide filthy things in a corner of their minds. You enjoy being with
the masses all the time, whereas some others enjoy being without the masses.
You are always a model of obedience to the party and its revolutionary
discipline, whereas some others regard the discipline as restraint for others
but not for themselves. For you, it is 'revolution first', 'work first',
and 'other people first', whereas for some others it is 'limelight first',
'rest first', and 'oneself first'. You always pick the most difficult things
to do, never avoiding your responsibilities, whereas some others choose easy
work to do, always shunning responsibilities. In all these respects, I admire
you and willing to continue to learn from you. I also hope that other party
members will learn from you. I write this congratulatory letter to you on
your sixtieth birthday with my wishes that you will enjoy good health and
a long life and continue to be a model for all the members of our revolutionary
party and all the people.
<P><strong>
Revolutionary Salute !</strong>
