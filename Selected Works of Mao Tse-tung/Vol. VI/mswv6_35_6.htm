  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE ANTI-JAPANESE WAR
</h1>
<P>
<h4>
  
  6. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SALT INDUSTRY
</h4>
<P>
Salt is the great resource of the Border Region. It is the mainstay which
balances imports and exports, stabilizes the currency, and regulates commodity
prices. A large proportion the people rely on salt [as a form of] exchange
for goods from outside. A relatively large proportion of the troops and working
personnel rely on salt for their livelihood or to supplement their livelihood.
Salt is also a major source of government financial revenue. Therefore salt
plays an extremely important role in the Border Region. Since the War of
Resistance began the supply of salt from the sea has been cut off and the
supply from the Huai area and from Shanxi has been reduced. The southwest
relies on salt from Sichuan and the northwest and the eastern areas on salt
from Ningsia and Qinghai. Salt from a Border Region has thus come to occupy
an important position and the transport and sale of salt increases annually.
In 1983 our salt exports were only 70,000 packs (each pack is 150 and each
<B><I>jin</I></B> is 24 <B><I>liang</I></B>.). In 1939 there was a sudden
increase to 190,000 packs. In 1940, the figure was 230,000 packs and in 1941
there was another abrupt increase to 299,068 packs. By September 1942 the
total was 155,790 packs and it is estimated that another 70,000-80,000 packs
can be sold in the last three months making a total of 230,000-240,000 packs.
These statistics reflect two important facts: the first is the external demand,
and the second is our hard work. Some comrades cannot see that external demand
is determined by the war of Resistance and that within certain limits salt
can be sold. Therefore they propose that things should follow their own course
and that there is no need for the Party and government to interfere. Other
comrades merely ascribe the yearly increase in the sale of salt to external
demand and do not recognize that the leadership of the Party and government
is a great factor in that increase. We began to pay attention to the salt
industry in autumn 1940. As well as the objective factor of the external
salt famine and depletion of salt stocks which made 1941 salt sales particularly
good, the abrupt increase from 230,000 packs in 1940 to 299,000 packs in
1941 was also due to the subjective factor that we implemented the policy
of supervising transport in that year. Apart from the fact that external
demand was not as urgent as in 1941, the sudden drop to 230,000-240,000 packs
in 1942 from the previous year's 299,000 was due to our abandonment of the
policy of supervising transport (putting an end to the many plans made by
the people for transporting salt). If we do not learn a lesson from this,
we shall repeat past mistakes in future work. Certainly there were defects
in the salt-industry work for 1941. The original plan to transport 600,000
packs was too big. The Border Region still does not have such a great transport
capacity. The achievement in producing 700,000 packs of salt was good but
the quality [of the salt] was too poor. Supervision of transport was correct
but it was unnecessary to mobilize everyone everywhere. There were also many
abuses in the organization and method of mobilization which did not accord
with the actual situation. All these things were shortcomings and mistakes
in our work in 1941. Nevertheless, adopting a policy of active development
of the salt industry was entirely correct. Belittling, misunderstanding and
even opposing this policy is entirely wrong.
<P>
What should be done in 1943? First we must determine a policy for active
development. In the current situation in the Border Region, we certainly
cannot adopt a negative approach towards salt which is a major factor in
solving financial problems (the publicly-run salt industry and the salt tax
), in balancing imports and exports, and in stabilizing the currency and
commodity prices. Therefore we must enlarge the already established Salt
Company into the main force for allying public and private salt industry
and for expanding public and private production, transport and sales. And
we must improve the quality of salt produced so as to promote sales. We must
restore transport supervision and organize all possible transport capacity
among the people to expand salt transport. We must draw in porters from outside
areas to transport and sell more. We must build roads, and arrange for inns,
warehouses and fodder to help transport. The Salt Company should gradually
gain control of outside sales in order to avoid the anarchic situation produced
by lack of public and private coordination. These are our general policies
for the active development of the salt industry in 1943, Concrete arrangements
should be as follows:
<P>
(1) Expand the Salt Company and increase its capital. Under the direction
of the Commodities Bureau raise share capital from the various official
organizations, the troops and privet individuals. Develop salt transport,
expand salt sales. Regulate salt prices. Guarantee that the company transports
40,000 pack in 1943, and with this salt as a basis buy as much salt from
the people as possible to carry out partial unification of salt sales to
outside areas. Afterwards, depending on the situation gradually achieve complete
unification so as to prevent outside manipulation and guarantee the interests
of the government and the people.
<P>
(2) In 1943, plan to produce 400,000 packs of salt and to transport
300,000-360,000 packs. Moreover strive to exceed this. As regards production,
continue the policy of supervision by officials and production by the people.
Ensure that the salt is mostly or entirely top-quality and do not allow inferior
quality to be produced again. As regards transport; plan for the Salt Company
system to transport 400,000 packs, draw in porters from outside to move 50,000
packs, and organize the manpower and animal power of the Border Region to
move 210,000-260,000 packs, making a total of 300,000-360,000 packs.
<P>
(3 ) The organization of the manpower and animal power of the Border Region
to transport 210,000-260,000 packs is immense, arduous and meticulous piece
of organizational and mass work. It should be directed by the Reconstruction
Department and supervised by the government at various levels, the Party
committees at each level having the responsibility for checking up and helping.
Mobilization to transport salt must have a degree of coercion but it certainly
must avoid commandism which causes damage. We must chiefly adopt the policy
of unit propaganda and persuasion. The organization to transport salt must
take the forms of transport cooperatives and transport teams. Propagandize
the masses to buy shares voluntarily. Some can provide manpower and some
can provide draught animal. Some can provide both. Some can provide running
costs and some, in special circumstances, can be exempted from providing
anything. We can organize transport teams among people who have rich experience
in portering, together with the necessary animals. The Party and government
at county, district and township level should actively direct the rational,
fair and health, organization of these transport teams. They should set off
smoothly, do the necessary work along the way and ensure the safety of the
personnel and animals. On return pay attention to the distribution of the
cooperative's profits and guarantee the interests of the people involved
and of all the cooperative members. Salt transport must not violate the
agricultural season. We must strengthen the organization of labour mutual-aid
cooperatives (exchange labour) so that after the transport team has set off,
the cooperative members do not lose agricultural production through lack
of manpower and animal power. As regards the salt-transport organizations
(cooperatives and teams) of the Sui-Mi special military area and the three
eastern counties, we should allow the masses greater freedom and reduce coercion.
The transport cooperatives and teams of all places must be built up on a
basis of benefiting the cooperative members. The duties of the Party and
government lie in making these benefits increase daily, otherwise we will
certainly be defeated. The Reconstruction Department, the sub-regions and
counties should teach the people through the most successful examples of
salt transport by the masses. They should propagandize them widely for imitation
so as to be certain that the plan for salt-transport in 1943 will be completed
and will also bring large direct benefits for the people.
<P>
(4) The enterprises of the Commodities Bureau and the people's cooperatives
in all places must closely coordinate with the people's transport cooperatives
and teams, and strive to ensure that the animals used by the people to transport
salt are able to transport other goods on their return journey. Only then
can the people's salt-transport undertaking expand and the whole of salt
transport develop, and only then will the whole salt-transport plan be completed.
<P>
(5) The key sector in developing the salt industry is transport, and the
major condition for transport is communications. In 1943 the government should
allocate 2 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> under the direction of the Reconstruction
Department for the building of two cart-roads between Yan'an and Dingbian,
and Dingbian and Qingyang, and for repairing the road from Yan'an to Fuxian.
Furthermore the Commodities Bureau should set up inns with stables and
trans-shipment warehouses along the main salt transport routes, and dig
water-storage holes in places lacking water. The Reconstruction Department
and Commodities Bureau together should plant alfalfa widely along the routes
and also provide fodder in other ways. So long as there are roads, inns,
grass and water, transport costs can be greatly cut, the volume of transport
can be greatly increased, and the three forms of transport - porters from
outside, people from the area and the Salt Company - can all develop. Plans
to improve the means of transport should also be directed by the Reconstruction
Department. Carts and handcarts should be built according to road conditions
in order to increase salt transport. Provided the roads are well built. it
is much better for the government to use more carts and the people to use
more handcarts than to use pack-animals.
<P>
(6) In 1943 the salt tax is fixed as 100,000 packs. Those who live near will
provide transport, those who live far away will provide a substitute, and
some will provide a mixture of both. However, the salt tax and the development
of the salt industry are two different matters. So long as we can definitely
export 300,000-360,000 packs, it does not matter whether we accept actual
salt or substitute payments for salt tax.
<P>
If we can complete our plans for planting cotton and spinning and weaving
in 1943, we can reduce our imports of raw cotton, cotton yarn and cotton
cloth. If we can export 300,000-360,000 packs of salt in 1943 at an average
value of 10 <B><I>yuan</I></B> Border Region currency per
<B><I>jin</I></B> (each donkey pack is 150 <B><I>jin</I></B>) our income
will be between 450 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> and 540 million
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. Thus by reducing one and increasing the other, the Border
Region's problem of balancing imports and exports will be entirely solved.
The following material reflects the people's experience in the transport
of salt during 1941.
<P>
<H4>
  A RECORD OF LU ZHONGCAI'S LONG MARCH
</H4>
<P>
Report on the first experiences in salt transport of Chengguan district,
Fuxian county, as told by the deputy leader of Chengguan district, Lu Zhongcai.
Supplemented by Wang Yuxian and Kong Zhaoqing. Recorded by Gao Kelin, 13
August 1941.
<P>
(l) For the first salt transport, Chengguan district should have provided
fifty pack animals. In fact it provided twenty-eight. The reason the plan
was not fulfilled was the lack of animals (at the very most we could mobilize
forty ). Some animals were hidden away and not kept at home. The district
government did not handle things firmly as it was busy with grain loans and
government bonds.
<P>
(2) We set off on 18 July and returned home on 11 August, a total of twenty-five
days. It took twelve days to get from Fuxian to Dingbian, one day to get
to Yanchi and load up, and twelve days to return. The longest stage was 90
<B><I>li</I></B>. The route, stage names and conditions during each stage
was as follows:
<P>
(i) From Fuxian to Zhangcunyi, 50 <B><I>li.</I></B> Five gullies and the
road was difficult. Good water and grass.
<P>
(ii) Zhangcunyi to Lannipo, altogether five stages, each 70 <B><I>li.
</I></B>Road good. Cut grass to feed the animals.
<P>
(iii) Lannipo to Lijiabian. 20 <B><I>li</I></B> of mountains and 40
<B><I>li</I></B> of gullies. Road difficult. Fodder no good.
<P>
(iv) Lijiabian to Lujiajiao. 30 <B><I>li</I></B> of gullies and 5
<B><I>li</I></B> of mountains. Most difficult to travel. Fodder no good .
<P>
(v) Lujiajiao to Luanshitouchuan. Travelling in gullies. There were military
stations. Fodder was sold (each 100 <B><I>jin</I></B> of mountain grass 30
<B><I>yuan</I></B> of valley grass 50 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, and wheat hay 40<I>
<B>yuan</B>.</I>).
<P>
(vi) Luanshitouchuan to Sanlimiao, 80 <B><I>li.</I></B> There were military
stations. Dry grass cost 50 <B><I>yuan</I></B> for 100 <B><I>jin</I></B>.
Forty <B><I>li</I></B> of mountains, very precipitous. Difficult to travel.
Water difficult ( Salt water not drinkable). Saw a salt-porter whose donkey
had fallen to its death.
<P>
(vii) Sanlimiao to Liangzhuang, 80 <B><I>li</I></B>.
<P>
(viii) Liangzhuang to Dingbian 90 <B><I>li.</I></B> There were military stations.
Fodder 50 to 100 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per 100 <B><I>jin</I></B>. No water.
<P>
(ix ) Dingbian to Yanchi, 40 <B><I>li.</I></B> One day there and back. Sandy
road difficult to travel.&nbsp;
<P>
(3) Difficulties along the route were:
<P>
(i) During three of the five stages from Zhangcunyi to Lannipo, locusts [zhameng]
were biting. It was best for men and animals to travel in the evening.
<P>
(ii) During the two stages from Sanlimiao to Liangzhuang and thence to Dingbian
there was no water. Men and animals were thirsty.
<P>
(iii) There were a lot of thieves at Dingbian. Animals, money, clothing and
tools often taken.
<P>
(iv) Beyond Luanshitouchuan since salt-transport animals from various counties
converge there are often several thousands or hundreds of animals travelling
together. Thus there are problems of inn space, fodder, water, and especially
of room to rest animals. Things can easily go wrong and cause trouble. &nbsp;
<P>
(4) Life on the road:
<P>
Chengguan district sent twenty-eight animals and fourteen men. Along the
way we cooked for ourselves. Each meal required 7 sheng of millet, roughly
25 <B><I>jin</I></B>. Everyone felt that 'We eat more when we have set out'.
Inn charges ranged from 3 <B><I>yuan</I></B> at the lowest to 8
<B><I>yuan</I></B> at the most. It depended entirely on whether you had a
good or bad relationship with the manager of the inn. When travelling we
sang and told stories, many of them about Duke Xiang seeking a wife. Everyone
was very happy and no one felt burdened. Animal fodder was cut in rotation.
It was plentiful and could not all be eaten up. The masses along the route
were very good, and there was no problem in getting grain and fodder, though
we chiefly relied on ourselves. Sometimes there were quarrels, mainly because
the animals had eaten someone's crops. Only in one place did the manager
of an inn give us bad grain.
<P>
(5} Points that arose during the journey:
<P>
Good :
<P>
(i) None of the animals had any illness. Those from the first and third townships
were thin when we set off but returned fat. This was because of the care
of the porters, and careful feeding.
<P>
(ii) None of the porters had any illness. Everyone was very fit and in good
spirits. No one grew thinner. They just got a little sunburned.
<P>
(iii) Nothing was left behind along the way and the animals did not eat people's
crops. This was mainly because deputy district head Lu Zhongcai's was an
old porter. He was experienced, responsible, and meticulous. Everyone else
was very active and thus we were successful.
<P>
Bad:
<P>
(i) Du Hai, head of the village council of the First administrative village
of the Third township, sold good donkey and bought a bad one to go. As a
result the donkey was exhausted, did not carry pack and we wasted 165
<B><I>yuan</I></B> in travel expenses. The township also sent another bad
animal (it had bad loins) and Jianjuntaicun of Fourth township sent donkey
with a bad leg. Neither carried salt and each wasted 165
<B><I>yuan</I></B> in travel expenses. Furthermore, the same village sent
a donkey with a rotten saddle with the result that its back was hurt through
the pressure of its load. The head of Second township had two donkeys. He
sent a bad one with a pod saddle and frame. This caused a lot of bother along
the way. The district-level government did not make a careful inspection
of these matters before we set out. Some were known about but not corrected.
As a result only twenty-five of the twenty-eight donkeys carried salt. The
other three travelled without loads, not contributing one bit to the value
of salt carried and wasting from 500 to 600 <B><I>yuan</I></B> in travel
costs. All in, the total loss was over 1,500 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. This is
a valuable warning for district and township cadres.
<P>
(ii) The head of the village council of Jianjuntaicun in Fourth township
did not obey deputy district head Lu Zhongcai's instructions. He did not
bring good fodder for the animals (oats <I>[<B>yumai</B>] </I>and broad beans
[<B><I>candou</I></B>]) and instead used kaoliang and other poor substitutes.
As a result the animals from that township sometimes lay down when travailing
because of their poor fodder. We are preparing to struggle against that village
head and punish him.
<P>
(iii) The porter Yang Wanbao from Fourth township was a real troublemaker
on the way. He pretended to be ill and skulked off home. He created wild
rumours, 'two people had died, deputy district head Lu and a man called Wang...
There was nothing to eat along the way... The donkeys' backs had all been
ruined under their loads... The inns could not sell grain...' so that many
people back in the town felt unhappy. The district head did not pay sufficient
attention to this. In future he should be alert.
<P>
(iv) Some families sent bad donkeys which carried less, only about 110
<B><I>jin</I></B>. One family from Jianjuntaicun in Fourth district changed
their donkey's halter for a bad one when they sent it off. They anticipated
the donkey would die and had made up their minds to write everything off.
The donkey from the head of Second township was only 10 <B><I>li</I></B>
from home on the way back when it lay down. He was unwilling to send a good
donkey to take over. He defaulted on his responsibility as he thought the
donkey would surely die and could not return. So he did not come and take
over.
<P>
(v) Twelve donkeys carried too much and 40 to 50 <B><I>jin</I></B> were given
to a donkey without a load. When we got to the tax inspection office at
Sunkeyaoxian they confiscated 50 <B><I>jin</I></B> of salt and one sack (value
20 <B><I>yuan</I></B>) because we had no certificate.
<P>
(6) Costs, losses and gains:
<P>
(i) Average expenses per donkey were: 2 <B><I>tou</I></B> of beans value
60 <B><I>yuan</I></B>; each man had 1.5 <B><I>tou</I></B> of grain and as
each man looked after two donkeys this equaled 0.75 <B><I>tou</I></B> per
donkey with a value of 35 <B><I>yuan</I></B>; travelling costs were 70
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The total 165 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. In addition there was
salt capital [yanben] of 20 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. The average cost per donkey
was thus 185 <B><I>yuan.</I></B>
<P>
(ii) On average each donkey from First township carried 130
<B><I>jin</I></B>, and from Second, Third and Fourth townships 110
<B><I>jin</I></B>. At present market prices of 200 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per
100 <B><I>jin</I></B> salt, each load was worth from 220 to 260
<B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
(iii) At current prices, after expenses are deducted, earnings per donkey
load ranged from 35 to 75 <B><I>yuan.</I></B>
<P>
Notes: (a) If each donkey were able to carry 150 <B><I>jin</I></B>, the
guaranteed income per donkey at current prices would be above 100
<B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
(b) Reports on amounts carried were given by the porters who were certainly
holding something in reserve&#151;most donkeys here can carry 150
<B><I>jin</I></B>.
<P>
(c) At the same time the principle is clear that so long as you have good
donkeys you can earn more. The worse the donkeys the less you earn, and you
can even make a loss.
<P>
(7) Experience and lessons:
<P>
(i) The victorious return of this salt-transport team from Chengguan district,
Fuxian, proves that the Party and government's plans, estimates and methods
for salt transport are entirely correct. The doubts, lack of trust and
considerations that it would be a burden by various comrades are all erroneous
and shallow outlooks.
<P>
(ii) We smashed the fears of some cadres and masses about going to Sanbian
for salt ( 'men and animals will die... they will go and not return'). On
the contrary the animals carrying salt returned fatter, and the men were
healthier and merely a little sunburned.
<P>
(iii) We proved that salt transport can earn money, and smashed the inaccurate
reckless talk that we 'certainly would lose capital', 'each donkey would
lose 100 <B><I>yuan</I></B>., and 'it is the greatest burden ever imposed
it the Border Region'.
<P>
(iv) We showed that certain cadres at district and township level, particularly
at township level, did not do their work responsibly (they did not inspect
carefully ), were prepared to cover-up things that were wrong (village and
township heads could send poor animals and were not investigated), were corrupt
(used poor kaoliang instead of beans ), and had become tails following behind
the masses.
<P>
(v) The cadres played a decisive role. Deputy district head Lu Zhongcai was
experienced, lively and responsible. Each time we reached a place or something
happened, he held a discussion meeting of the porters &#151; he even discussed
how much salt each donkey should carry. As a result neither men nor animals
came to any harm and on the contrary ended up stronger and in better spirits
than when they set out.
<P>
Lessons:
<P>
(i) The district and township cadres did not pay attention to and investigate
at the right time the troublemaker from Fourth township, Yang Wanbao who
skulked off home and created rumours. They did not talk to him and did not
report to higher levels. As a result a rumour spread among the people of
the district that two people had died - deputy district head Lu and somebody
Wang - and that three donkeys had died. This made people very uneasy.
<P>
(ii) There were problems along the way (some stages were hard going, one
or two had many locusts, and two had little water) but they could be overcome.
On bad roads we had to be more careful. Where there were locusts we travelled
in the evening. Where there was little water we drank more on getting up
in the morning and carried water with us. With patience all difficulties
could be overcome.
<P>
(iii ) The better the donkeys, the more we can earn. If we could earn 75
<B><I>yuan</I></B> for each donkey that carried I30 <B><I>jin</I></B> this
time, we can earn 115 <B><I>yuan</I></B> for donkeys carrying 150
<B><I>jin</I></B>, The worse the donkeys the less we can earn, and we can
even make a loss. For example, Chengguan district sent three poor donkeys
(one with bad loins, one with bad legs, and one was exhausted). As a result
they did not carry salt. Each donkey wasted 165<B><I> yuan</I></B> in travailing
expenses and the total loss including porters was over 1,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. At the same time this showed that work must be done carefully
and you cannot muddle through. If the district and township had carefully
inspected the donkeys sent this time, worked conscientiously, and not given
any favours, we, would not have made these losses since everyone would have
known about the poor donkeys.
<P>
(iv) If we had not stayed at inns along the way and let the animals out to
pasture not buying hay, we could have saved over 50 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per
donkey. What we save becomes earnings.
<P>
(v) We must pay more attention to the national laws. Because we were not
careful we had 50 <B><I>jin</I></B> of salt and one sack confiscated. This
was an unnecessary loss. ( This report was published in the <B><I>Liberation
Daily</I></B> 14, 15 September 1941.)
