The young people &#151; whether or not they be members of the Communist Party
&#151; who join the ranks of the revolutionary movement, bringing new blood
and enthusiasm, are all very precious. Without them, the ranks of the revolution
could not develop and the revolution could not triumph. But lack of experience
is the natural failing of our young comrades. Now revolutionary experience
comes from personal participation in revolutionary struggle. If one begins
working at the grass roots, if, for several years, one does work that is
genuine, not false, then experience will come to those who do not have it.
