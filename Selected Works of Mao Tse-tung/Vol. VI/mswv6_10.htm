Young communists and non-communists who have brought new blood and new spirit
to the revolutionary ranks are precious people. Without them the ranks can
never be expanded and the revolution can never be won. However, their weakness
lies in a lack of experience, and experience comes only from personal
participation in revolutionary struggles. The inexperienced can become
experienced if they begin from the lowest level and work steadily without
a grain of dishonesty for several years.
