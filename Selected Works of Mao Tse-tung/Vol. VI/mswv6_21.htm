Question: In actual practice, if the Chinese revolution were victorious would
the economic and political relationship between Soviet China and Soviet Russia
be maintained within the Third International or a similar organization, or
would there probably be some kind of actual merger of governments? Would
the Chinese Soviet Government be comparable in its relation to Moscow to
the present government of Outer Mongolia?
<p>
Answer: I assume this is a purely hypothetical question. As I have told you,
the Red Army is not now seeking the hegemony of power but a united China
against Japanese imperialism.
<p>
The Third International is an organization in which the vanguard of the world
proletariat brings together its collective experience for the benefit of
all revolutionary peoples throughout the world. It is not an administrative
organization nor has it any political power beyond that of an advisory capacity.
Structurally it is not very different from the Second International, though
in content it is vastly different. But just as no one would say that in a
country where the Cabinet is organized by the social-democrats, the Second
International is dictator, so it is ridiculous to say that the Third
International is dictator in countries where there are communist parties.
<p>
In the U.S.S.R., the Communist Party is in power, yet even there the Third
International does not rule nor does it have any direct political power over
the people at all. Similarly, it can be said that although the Communist
Party of China is a member of the Comintern, still this in no sense means
that Soviet China is ruled by Moscow or by the Comintern. We are certainly
not fighting for an emancipated China in order to turn the country over to
Moscow!
<p>
The Chinese Communist Party is only one party in China and in its victory
it will have to speak for the whole nation. It cannot speak for the Russian
people or rule for the Third International but only in the interest of the
Chinese masses. Only where the interests of the Chinese masses coincide with
the interests of the Russian masses can it be said to be obeying the will
of Moscow. But of course this basis of common benefit will be tremendously
broadened, once the masses of China are in democratic power and socially
and economically emancipated like their brothers in Russia.
<p>
When Soviet government have been established in many countries, the problem
of an international union of soviets may arise, and it will be interesting
to see how it will be solved. But today I cannot suggest the formula, it
is a problem which has not been and cannot be solved in advance. In the world
of today with increasingly close economic and cultural intimacies between
different states and people, such union would seem to be highly desirable,
if achieved on a voluntary basis.
<p>
<p>
Clearly, however, the last point is of utmost importance; such a world union
could be successful only if every nation had the right to enter or leave
the union according to the will of its people, and with its sovereign intact,
and certainly never at the 'command' of Moscow. No communist ever thought
otherwise, and the myth of 'world domination from Moscow' is an invention
of the fascists and counter-revolutionaries.
<p>
<p>
The relationship between Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union, now and in
the past, has always been based on the principle of complete equality. When
the people's revolution has been victorious in China, the Outer Mongolian
republic will automatically become a part of the Chinese federation, at its
own will. The Mohammedan and Tibetan people, likewise, will form autonomous
republics attached to the China federation.
<p>
Question: With the achievement of victory of a Red movement in China, do
you think that revolution would occur quickly in other Asiatic colonial or
semi-colonial countries such as Korea, Indochina, the Philippines, and India?
Is China at present the 'key" to the world revolution?
<p>
Answer: The Chinese revolution is a key factor in the world situation and
its victory is heartily anticipated by the people of every country, especially
by the toiling masses of the colonial countries. When the Chinese revolution
comes into full power, the masses of many colonial countries will follow
the example of China and win a similar victory of their own&#133;
