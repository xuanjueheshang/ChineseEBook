<p>
All the past experiences prove that only through the correct solution of
the land question, only through the resolute class slogan under which the
flame of class struggle in the countryside is whipped up to the highest degree,
can we spur the broad peasant masses to participate under the leadership
of the proletariat in the revolutionary war, in the construction of the Soviet
Areas in the various spheres, and in the building of a firm revolutionary
base to further strengthen the soviet movement and score greater progress
and victory.&nbsp;
<p>
According to the experience in developing the land revolution, the growth
of class struggle in the countryside calls for three general stages to follow,
namely, 1) the stage of land confiscation and distribution, 2) the stage
of land investigation, 3) the stage of land construction . Based on the three
stages of development in the land struggle, there exist generally three types
of regions regardless of any soviet area, namely, 1) the region where the
struggle has deepened, 2) the region where the struggle has relatively fallen
behind, 3 ) the region where the struggle is newly developing.
<p>
In the newly developing region, the development of land struggle is still
at the stage of land confiscation and distribution. The central question
at this stage is to overturn by armed power the political power of the landlord
class, to establish a revolutionary provisional political power (the
Revolutionary Committee), to build a local armed force of the workers and
peasants as well as revolutionary mass organizations, to confiscate the land
and property belonging to the landlord class plus the land of rich peasants
to be divided among the hired hands, poor peasants, middle peasants, to give
the rich peasants the poor land, to nullify debts and to burn land titles
and IOUs. Involved in the struggle at this stage is the whole range of struggle
in which the revolution commences battle with the counter-revolution by the
revolution and implementing the disposition of their land and property.
<p>
In the region where the struggle has deepened, a firm soviet political power
has been established and local armed forces and revolutionary mass organizations
have developed extensively; the feudal forces of landlords and rich peasants
have been completely defeated and the land has been thoroughly distributed.
The struggle of the peasant masses over the land question has advanced to
the stage of improving the soil and developing soil productivity. Therefore,
the central question here is one of land construction.
<p>
In the region where the struggle has fallen behind, its stage of development
is between the two stages mentioned above. It has moved into the period of
a formal political power from that of a provisional political power but it
has not yet reached the period completely consolidating the political power.
Here the open counter-revolutionary struggle of the landlords and rich peasants
have been defeated by the revolutionary masses in the first period. From
that time on, many of these elements would turn about, take off their
counter-revolutionary mask and put on the revolutionary mask. They too approve
the revolution and the land redistribution as well, and call themselves poor
peasants and demand that the land be distributed to them accordingly. They
act actively by virtue of their historical advantage in that "come to think
of talking, they can talk; come to think of writing, they can write." Therefore,
during the first period they have taken advantage of the opportunity to snatch
away the fruit of land revolution. Facts in many places proved that they
are dominating the provisional political power by sneaking into the local
armed forces and manipulating the revolutionary organizations to get more
and better land than what the poor peasants have obtained. Having moved into
the second, some of those sham revolutionary elements have been washed out
because of the pressure of the upper-level government as well as the advancement
of mass struggle, and because the Revolutionary Committee has been reconstructed
into the soviet, and the mass organizations and local armed forces have undergone
the preliminary reform and further growth. In many places the land has been
divided twice, even three or four times, and the land stolen by the landlords
and rich peasants has been in par liquidated. However, there are still many
class heretics hidden among the soviet mass organizations and local armed
forces. There they "carry Red ribbons to be called comrades," there they
fabricate rumors and hold secret meetings, there they accuse the masses of
"left opportunism," of "random beating of local bullies," and of "public
revenge for private animosity." Or they "speak articulately at a meeting
but carry out none after the meeting." When the struggle becomes violent,
they organize secret counter-revolutionary organizations like the KMT, the
Social Democratic Party, the A-B Corps, and a New Communist Party, as well
as all kinds of things, to subvert the revolution and try to murder revolutionary
activities. In short, the landlord and rich peasant classes suppress the
mass struggle through various methods and attempt to preserve their rights
to political power, land and property and perpetuate their remaining feudal
forces. In these regions serious struggles are being waged between the
revolutionary masses and the landlords and rich peasants. The struggle here,
however, is not like the open struggle between the Red banner during the
first period but a struggle between the revolutionary peasant masses and
the masked landlords and rich peasants elements. The struggle of this kind
has its special difficulty, that is, the peasant masses cannot as nearly
clearly recognize at a first glance hidden counter-revolutionary as the open
counter-revolutionary. In addition, in view of the various deep-rooted feudal
relations like the clannish ones, it is not an easy matter for the peasants
to attain the degree of class consciousness, so that they can generally recognize
that the feudal remnants should be stamped out eventually. This means that
the Communist Party and the soviet government must certainly be patient in
explaining to the peasants, they must engage in many trying tasks, and that
they must have the correct class line and the [correct] method of the mass
work. The central question here is the question of land investigation and
class investigation. Unless this question is solved, revolutionary activeness
of the peasant masses cannot be developed to the fullest, feudal remnant
forces cannot be completely smashed; nor the soviet can [carry on] the important
tasks as to attain the maximum degree of consolidation and expansion of the
Red Army, to expand the local armed forces and implement land construction
as well as economic construction, and to develop culture and education.
[Otherwise], in no way can all this gain its maximum success. Therefore land
investigation campaign is the most central and most important task in these
regions.
<p>
Speaking of the Central Soviet Area [i.e. Kiangsi Soviet], most part of the
Area constitute the regions where the struggle of this kind has relatively
fallen behind, such as the thirteen whole counties, Huich&#146;ang, Hsianwu,
Anyuan, Hsianfeng, Loan, Yuhuang, Kwangch&#146;ang, Shihch&#146;eng, Chienning,
Lich&#146;uan. Ninghua, Ch&#146;angting and Wup&#146;ing, most of the counties
like Juichin. Yutu, Posheng, Shengli. And Yungfeng, portions of the counties
like Kunglueh, Want&#146;ai, Kanhsien, Shanghang, Yungting, and Hsinch&#146;uan
and even the county Hsiangkuo, too has two districts Chunch&#146;un and
Huangt&#146;ang.
<p>
All these represent the regions where the land question has not yet been
thoroughly resolved.
<p>
The peasant masses of these regions have not yet been spurred broadly; the
feudal forces have not yet been beaten decisively, and in the soviets, in
the mass organizations, and in the local armed forces, there are still numerous
class heretics who are surreptitiously active; there are still numerous
counter-revolutionary secret organizations which are secretly engaging in
the subversion of the revolution. For this reason, war mobilization and economic
and cultural construction all have fallen far behind the advanced areas (nearly
the entire county of Hsiangkuo, section of the counties Shengli, Kanhsien,
Wangt&#146;ai, Kunglueh, Yungfeng, and Shanghang, Huangp&#146;o District
of Posheng, Wuyang District of Juichin, Hsianp&#146;o District of Yutu, Hsinan
District of Yungting, and etc.). These regions occupy nearly eighty percent
of the Central [Soviet] Area in acreage and contain more than two million
people. In this vast area to carry out an all-round deepening land investigation
campaign, to kindle to the maximum degree the flame of class struggle among
the masses of two million people and more, to wage a final war against the
feudal forces to destroy them once and for all, are the tasks that the Communist
Party and the Soviet Government cannot afford to relax for a moment<B>.</B>
