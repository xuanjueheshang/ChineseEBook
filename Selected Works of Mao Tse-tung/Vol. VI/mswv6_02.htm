Dear Mr. Hakuro Toten,
<P>
We have long admired your integrity but regret not having had the privilege
of your acquaintance. Even at this great distance your reputation is enough
to inspire us.
<P>
Sir, you gave moral support to Huang<B>[<A HREF="#fn2">2</A>]</B> [when he
was alive] and now mourn him with your tears. He is to be buried, and you
have come across a myriad leagues of waves to bid him farewell at his grave.
Your lofty friendship reaches as high as the sun and moon; your sincerity
moves gods and spirits. Both are rare in this world, in the past as well
today.
<P>
Chih-fan and Tse-tung are schoolboys in Hunan who have acquired some knowledge
of the classics and have disciplined their aspirations. We long to have an
opportunity to meet you, to learn deportment and receive instructions from
you. We shall feel extremely honoured if our request is granted<I>.</I>
