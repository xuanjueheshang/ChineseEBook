  INSCRIPTION FOR THE FOUNDING OF THE NORTH SHENSI PUBLIC SCHOOL
</H1><p class="title">
1937
<p>
We must educate a lot of people &#151; the sort of people who are the vanguard
of revolution, who have political farsightedness, who are prepared for battle
and sacrifice, who are frank, loyal, positive, and upright; the sort of people
who seek no self-interest, only national and social emancipation, who show,
instead of fear, determination and forwardness in the face of hardships;
the sort of people who are neither undisciplined nor fond of limelight, but
practical, with their feet firmly on the ground. If China possesses many
such men, the tasks of the Chinese revolution can easily be fulfilled.
