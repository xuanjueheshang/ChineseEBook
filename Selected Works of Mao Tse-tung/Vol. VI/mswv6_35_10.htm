  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE ANTI-JAPANESE WAR
</h1>
<P>
<h4>
  <B>10. ON GRAIN WORK</B>
</h4>
<P>
We have now completed our discussion of economic work. Our economy is divided
into the two large private and public sectors. The private sector of the
economy includes agriculture, animal husbandry, handicrafts, cooperatives
and salt undertakings. The public sector consists of the undertakings run
by the government, the army, and the official organizations and schools.
We have looked at all these things. We have not discussed commerce in the
private sector since we still lack the necessary information. For the moment
we have to ignore it. Now we must discuss the problems of finance. However,
we shall not look at all of its aspects but just look at three questions:
(i) the question of grain, (ii) the question of taxation, and (iii) the question
of economizing.
<P>
Our finances depend on two sources, the people and ourselves. Financial work
for the portion supplied by ourselves is basically distribution and supply
work when the process of production by the three elements of the public sector
of the economy is completed and becomes a process of distribution. The public
sector of the economy is the primary foundation for our finances and supplies.
It provided three-fifths of all finances and supplies during 1942. Thus our
primary financial work consists of properly carrying out the distribution
of the fruits of production in the public sector. We have already discussed
this question at length as a supplementary factor when dealing with the public
sector of the economy and there is no space to say more about the details
here. It can wait for further studies. Now we must discuss the second foundation
for our finances and supplies &#151; the portion obtained from the people,
namely grain and tax. There is also the question of economizing. This is
related to what we get from the people and what we supply ourselves. It is
a question related to the whole of the resources we already possess and to
the correct distribution and use of the funds for running our undertakings.
Therefore it is an important financial problem. The grain question referred
to here is the grain tax alone and not all grain problems. This is part of
the tax system. However, since it is related to all the needs of the army
and government, and to the relationship of 80 to 90 per cent of the people
of the Border Region with the Party, the Eighth Route Army and the government,
it is worth specially setting it aside from the general question of taxation
and dealing with it first.
<P>
More than 90 per cent of the 1,400,000 people in the Border Region are peasants.
Landlords and merchants make up less than 10 per cent. Over half of these
peasants have obtained a share of land and the other half have not yet done
so. Why are we striving to the utmost to enable the peasants to develop
agriculture? In the first place our aim is to enable the peasants to grow
richer and improve their life. Secondly, we want the peasants to be capable
of paying grain tax to help meet the needs of the War of Resistance. There
is also a third reason which is that we want the peasants, after obtaining
a reduction in rent and in interest rates, to develop agricultural production
in order to be able to pay part as land rent to the landlords, and thus to
unite the landlords with ourselves in the War of Resistance. We must only
do one thing to achieve these three aims and that is strive to the utmost
to enable the peasants to develop agriculture. The more agricultural production
develops and the greater the amount of agricultural and subsidiary products
tile peasants harvest each year, then the less the amount of grain tax paid
to the government becomes as a proportion of their total harvest. We propose
to levy an annual grain tax of 180,000 <B><I>tan</I></B> beginning in 1943.
We intend to keep this amount as fixed in the following few years even if
as a result of agricultural development the total amount of grain produced
in the Border Region increases from its present level of around 1,500,000
<B><I>tan</I></B>. (Many comrades estimate that with better use of existing
labour power, we can raise the total production of the Border Region to 2
million <B><I>tan</I></B>. All increases will thus accrue to the peasants,
making them keen to work hard to develop their own production, and enabling
them to improve their own livelihood and to dress and eat well.
<P>
All comrades throughout the Border Region must learn from the way the comrades
of Yan'an county strive to<I> </I>work in the interests of the peasants,
so that the peasants rapidly get richer. The richer the peasants become,
the less they take exception to handing over a fixed amount of grain tax
and the more they feel close to and inseparable from the Communist Party,
the Eighth Route Army and the Border Region Government The peasant Wu Manyou
of Yan'an county is clear proof of this. On 30 April 1942, the Liberation
Daily carried the following report on him.
<h4>
<B>THE MODEL RURAL LABOUR HERO, WU MANYOU EXCELS IN OPENING NEW LAND AND
HARVESTING GRAIN FOR SEVERAL YEARS RUNNING, AND INFLUENCES THE MASSES TO
TAKE PART ACTIVELY IN SPRING PLOUGHING</B></h4>
<P>
(Our special report.) Rural labour heroes appear one after another in the
spring ploughing movement. In order to express their deep devotion to the
Border Region, to consolidate the Region and to improve their own life, they
display the spirit of labour to a high degree. Among them, Wu Manyou from
Luilin district in Yan'an county is especially respected by most peasants.
Every year his harvest of grain exceeds that of others by one-sixth. The
two labour powers in his family farm over 120 <B><I>mu</I></B> of land. This
year they opened up 35 <B><I>mu</I></B> of uncultivated land. He is already
publicly recognized as a model labour hero by the peasants of the township.
According to late news last night, the Reconstruction Department of the Border
Region Government has decided to give him a special award.
<P>
(Our report from Yan'an.) For successive years the peasant Wu Manyou of
Wujiacaoyuan in Second township, Liulin district, Yan'an county has been
active in spring ploughing and grown good crops. Usually people get an average
of 5 <B><I>tou</I></B> from every 3 <B><I>mu</I></B>; he gets 6
<B><I>tou.</I></B> Thus when the government issued the call for great efforts
in spring ploughing he said; 'I have benefited from the revolution and I
can never forget it. I truly love the Border Region and at the same time
I work to improve my own life'. He redoubled his efforts at opening up new
land and influenced the masses. He created an enthusiastic spring ploughing
movement in his own village. All the peasants in Yan'an county know that
Wu Manyou's township did the best farming this year. Wu Manyou originally
planned to open up 35 <B><I>mu</I></B>. He had already opened up 15
<B><I>mu</I></B> before it rained, and he was even more active afterwards.
He said: 'I can finish clearing the new land in ten days, and if there is
time I'll exceed the plan'. As for his other l00-odd <B><I>mu</I></B> of
cultivated land, some parts have already been seeded and some parts have
already been turned over. All the inhabitants of Wujiacaoyuan, the village
head, the head of the township, and the head of the district unanimously
praise him<I> </I>as 'a model hero in spring ploughing'. Now the district
government has applied to higher levels to reward him. On hearing this the
Border Region Government also decided after practical investigation to give
him a suitable reward as an incentive.
<P>
(Our report from Yan'an county.) During the spring ploughing movement many
labour heroes have appeared, but in the final analysis who is best at growing
crops? To clear up this question our reporters spent a month visiting various
villages. Now they have found the model labour hero generally recognized
by the masses. This model hero's name is Wu Manyou. This year he is forty-nine.
He is well built and strong. Before the land revolution he was a tenant farmer.
At that time he had to eat leaves and husks. He 'suffered hardship' [worked
for ethers] by cutting firewood. The money he earned he had to pay as taxes
to the local bad officials and rich gentry, and he himself usually went hungry.
After the Land revolution, he joined the revolution. He was given a share
of land on the hills, roughly 40 <B><I>shang</I></B> equal to 120-odd
<B><I>mu</I></B>. Apart from this private land, he has actively opened up
and sown uncultivated land in successive years, and he raises cows and sheep.
Now all the hill land is cultivated and he has two bullocks, three cows and
more than a hundred sheep. His prospects grow brighter and brighter. He has
got married, and eats and dresses well. Last year after government examination
his family status was raised from poor peasant to middle peasant. He often
says: 'When I think of the past and then of the present, how can I forget
the benefits, of the revolution and of the Border Region?'
<P>
(Our report from Yan'an county). Model labour hero, Wu Manyou, plants crops
like any other peasant. Why does he reap more grain than others? According
to the peasants in his village there are several reasons. First, he gets
up earlier than anyone else and goes to bed later. Before the sky grows light
he has fed his cows and gone up the hill. He only comes back from his land
when the sky is dark. He can really endure hard work. Second, in winter when
there is no work to do, he diligently collects manure. As he also can raise
sheep and cows, he has more manure than others. On average he applies seven
pack loads of manure to every 3 <B><I>mu</I></B>. Third, when the crops begin
to shoot, some peasants are afraid to go up into the hills. They do not hoe
the weeds or only hoe once at the most. He hoes twice at least, so his millet
naturally grows well. Fourth, he plough deeply. Other households plough down
5 inches he ploughs down 7 inches at least. Fifth, when breaking up the earth,
he breaks it finely and is not careless. Sixth, he always ploughs and sows
at the correct time, neither early nor late. Because of these fine qualities,
he harvests a top yield per 3 <B><I>mu</I></B> of 12 <B><I>tou</I></B> on
the old scale (18 <B><I>tou</I></B> on the market scale} and a lowest of
4 <B><I>tou</I></B> (6 market <B><I>tou</I></B> ). The average is 6
<B><I>tou</I></B> (9 market <B><I>tou</I></B>). The average for other peasants
is 5 <B><I>tou</I></B> (7 market <B><I>tou</I></B>). In terms of averages,
he is one-sixth better than others.
<P>
(Our report from Yan'an county.) Model labour hero, Wu Manyou, is not only
a model at growing crops but is also a model citizen. nest year he harvested
18 market <B><I>tan</I></B> of wheat (<B><I>xiaomai</I></B>) and 27 market
<B><I>tan</I></B> of grains (equivalent to 16 <B><I>tan</I></B> 2
<B><I>tou</I></B> of hulled grains). He paid 14 <B><I>tan</I></B> <I>3
<B>tou</B></I> in grain tax, 1,000 <B><I>jin</I></B> of hay tax, contributed
two lots of 150 <B><I>yuan</I></B> to government bonds, and paid 665
<B><I>yuan</I></B> cash substitute for the salt tax. The villagers said to
him: 'Old Wu, you pay out too much, cut down a bit! He said 'During the
revolution, the Eighth Route Army protects our Border Region. People at the
front loose blood. All we have to do is sweat a little more. How can you
say "Too much"?' Afterwards everyone respected his opinion and enthusiastically
gave grain to the State. This year the upper levels moved some refugees to
live in the village. He lent grain and hoes to them and helped them find
uncultivated land. He also often encouraged them materially and in spirit
to open up and plant land. Usually he is also the most fair person in the
village. His prestige among the ordinary people is very high and everyone
trusts him. In May last year he was elected a member of the township council
and director of the township's work in supporting families with dependents
fighting in the War of Resistance. He has a younger brother who is a soldier
with the Eight Route Army, so he himself belongs to such a family but he
declined public support. He said: 'Fighting is the duty of the Chinese people,
there is nothing strange about it<I>. </I>I've enough to eat, what other
support do I need?' However, he is extremely correct towards other families
in the township with dependents at the front. At the same time he is very
fair in his distribution of labour duties. There are twelve families in the
township with dependents fighting in the war. This year he arranged substitute
farming for 220 <B><I>mu</I></B> and all the families were grateful to him.
No one in township says he is not good.
<P>
(Our report from Yan'an county.) There are fourteen peasants sent households
in Wujiacaoyuan with fourteen heads of family. When you raise the question
of whether Wu Manyou is worthy of being called a model labour hero, everyone
raises his thumb and says 'What else can be said about old Wu. He is the
best at enduring hardship. If he isn't a hero who is fit to be?
<P>
On 2 June there was another report in the Liberation Daily.
<P>
Because of the influence of the labour hero, Wu Manyou, Wujiacaoyuan which
originally planned to open up 147 <B><I>mu</I></B> of undo cultivated land,
had already opened up 225 <B><I>mu</I></B>. Wu Manyou himself opened up 15
<B><I>mu</I></B>. After Wu Manyou was rewarded the whole town ship (Second
township, Luilin district) opened up 540 <B><I>mu.</I></B>
<P>
On 29 October, the Liberation Daily carried a further report.
<P>
This year the harvest of coarse millet is very good. In Wu Manyou's village
the yield per 3 <B><I>mu</I></B> is in general 5 to 6 <B><I>tou</I></B> but
he has got 8 <B><I>tou</I></B> (each <B><I>tou</I></B> is the large kind
equivalent to 45 <B><I>jin</I></B>). Most peasants get 3 or 4
<B><I>tou</I></B> of hulled grain from husking 1 <B><I>tan</I></B> of coarse
grains. He always maintains the official standard for the equivalent amount
of hulled grain. Wu Manyou often puts on a propagandistic air and says to
others: 'If you want to get your crops as good as mine, learn from me! I
have no secret, I am simply willing to labour' .
<P>
Wu Manyou is already a rich peasant. Because he got benefits from the soviet
government in the past and the Border Region Government now, he has united
his destiny with that of the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army and the
Border Region Government. All empty words are useless, we must give the people
visible material wealth. The minds of many of our comrades have still not
fully turned into the minds of communists. They only know how to do one kind
of work, asking the people for this and that, for grain, for hay, for taxes
and for mobilization for various kinds of work. They do not know how to do
the other kind of work, striving to the utmost to help the people develop
production and to improve their cultural level. It is entirely rational for
us to ask things of the people for the sake of the revolution and the War
of Resistance. It is good that our comrades consider that in doing this work
they are doing the work they should do for the revolution. But it is only
doing one aspect of work and it is not the primary aspect. The primary aspect
of our work is not to ask things of the people but to give things to the
people. What can we give the people? Under present conditions in the
Shaan-Kan-Ning Border Region, we can organize, lead and help the people to
develop production and increase their material wealth. And on this basis
we can step-by-step raise their political awareness and cultural level. To
these ends we must endure all discomforts and night and day, diligently and
thoroughly look into the people's problems in their livelihood and production,
including such important matters as plough-oxen; agricultural implements,
seeds, manure, water conservancy, animal fodder, agricultural credit,
immigration, opening up new land, improving agricultural methods, female
labour, labour by loafers, plains for setting up households, cooperatives,
exchange-labour teams, transport teams, textiles, animal husbandry, salt
industry and so forth. Moreover, we must concretely help the people to solve
these problems and not use empty words. This work is the primary work for
all Communist Party members working in the countryside. Only after we have
done this aspect of work and achieved real results can we get the people'
s support when we do the second aspect of our work which is to ask them for
things. Only then will they say that our requests are necessary and correct.
Only then will they understand that if they do not give grain, hay and other
things to the government, their life cannot be good and cannot get better.
Only in this way will our work not be done through coercion. Only in this
way will things run smoothly, and only in this way will we be truly united
with the people. This is the basic line and policy of our party. Every comrade
(including those in the army) should study this thoroughly. Only when our
comrades understand and carry out the complementary nature of these two aspects
of work, can we call ourselves all-round communist revolutionaries. Otherwise,
although we do revolutionary work and although we are revolutionaries, we
shall still not be all round revolutionaries. Furthermore, some comrades
are still bureaucrats remote from the masses. Because they only know how
to ask the masses for things and do not know how to or are unwilling to give
things to the masses, the masses detest them. This question is extremely
important. I hope everyone will pay great attention to it and propagandize
the principle throughout the whole party.
<P>
In what follows we shall sum up our past experience in grain work and point
out the policy for 1943.
<P>
From 1937 to 1939, the grain tax levied in the Border Region covered only
a part of supplies. The deficiency each year was made up by purchase using
funds issued by the government. With the exception of particular areas and
periods when there were grain difficulties, there were no insurmountable
problems in the whole of grain supply for the four years. During that time
we actually enabled the people to build up their resources. The burdens of
grain tax were heavy on the rich peasants and landlords, very light on the
middle peasants and most poor peasants had none at all. In 1940 outside aid
was cut off and the government had no resources to buy grain. We had to turn
to raising all of it in tax. However, the principle of 'calculating tax on
the basis of income' had not yet changed. Also the grain tax for 1940 was
raised to only 90,000 <B><I>tan</I></B> and the policies for collection were
not altered. For supplies in the following year (1941) we put forward the
policy of 'strengthening grain administration and ensuring grain sufficiency'.
However, we could not provide all supplies since we had not levied much grain
in 1940. There was also the related matter of achieving self-sufficiency
in running costs in 1941, in connection with which the various army units
and official organizations paid careful attention to grain in order to solve
problems in livelihood. Another factor was that since the organizational
structure of the departments doing grain work was not yet strong and the
quality of the cadres was not good enough, the various regulations were not
well established and we could not fully control grain income and expenditure
in all places. At the time the problems of making excessive returns and rash
leadership were very serious, was constantly changing, increasing and decreasing,
and was too much occasional expenditure outside the set amount. The grain
tax levied in 1940 provided supplies until March 1941, when some places already
had nothing to eat. Before long there was a panic over grain everywhere.
It was only by successively buying grain once and borrowing twice that we
lasted until November. In order to guarantee supplies for 1942 and to repay
loans taken in 1941, it was estimated that a levy of 200,000
<B><I>tan</I></B> was essential. At this time the problem of grain had already
become the most serious financial problem. After repeated study by the Party
and government and under the new principle for collection of 'calculating
tax first on the basis of our expenditure and second on the basis of income',
it was decided to levy 20.000 <B><I>tan</I></B> of grain and 26 million
<B><I>jin</I></B> of hay. To ensure collection of this amount of grain and
taking the interests of all social strata into account, the base for collection
was expanded. The burden on the middle peasants was increased and the poor
peasants began to bear some of it. We corrected the earlier of bias towards
the minority of wealthy.
<P>
The grain accounts at the various county granaries were not clearly kept
in the past, and the great muddle in the formalities for buying and borrowing
grain during 1941 had increased the difficulties of sorting them out. The
Grain Office was deeply afraid that the lack of clarity over the old grain
would influence the new. Therefore 'grasp the new grain, ensure supplies
was made the strategy for work in 1942. Events during the year showed that
although there were deficiencies in implementation, the policy itself was
entirely correct. Grain tax for 1942 was reduced to 160,000
<B><I>tan</I></B> and hay tax to 16 million <B><I>jin</I></B>. The policy
for collection also reduced the burden on the poor peasants slightly.
Furthermore, we are preparing to implement a unified progressive agricultural
tax in 1943 in place of the grain-tax method. In order to raise the peasants'
enthusiasm for production, we lent them some of the grain and hay during
1942 to help them solve problems during spring ploughing. In supply work
the thing is to concentrate on grain and hay.
<P>
As regards the work of collection, we only levied 10,000
<B><I>tan</I></B> in 1937 and 1938. The burden on the masses was very light
and everyone was willing to pay. In 1939 the amount was raised to 50,000
<B><I>tan.</I></B> The government proclaimed new regulations for collecting
the grain. Work groups were sent down to the countryside to make surveys
and to collect tax according to the regulations. However, in reality, 50,000
<B><I>tan</I></B> was still a very slight amount of grain tax for the masses
to bear. The cadres were used to the method of democratic apportionment of
taxes and the survey work was very perfunctory. The so-called collection
to regulations remained a theory. In 1940 it was just the same. Only in 1941
when the grain-tax burden suddenly increased to 200,00 <B><I>tan</I></B>
did the government again seriously revise the regulations. The Finance Department
sent large numbers of work groups to the counties to work with the county
and district governments in carrying out fairly thorough-going surveys so
that the masses' burdens were made rational. This grain collection emphasized
'thorough-going surveys' and 'carrying out the regulations'. Summing up
collection in 1941, there is clear proof that if good survey work is done,
it is easy to carry out the regulations. For example, Ganquan county was
very conscientious in making surveys and then implemented the regulations
and rates for collection. Quzi county carried out three surveys and was able
to ensure a fair and rational distribution of the burden. In Baima district
of Huachi county the requirement was not filled after two allocations. Eventually
the head of the grain collection work group, Comrade Wang, himself surveyed
one township to get experience. As a result the whole district over-fulfilled
its quota by several tens of <B><I>tan. </I></B>In places where survey work
was poorly done, such as in the special military area, the regulations could
not be carried out. In general county cadres still treated survey work too
lightly. Only a minority of them carried out thorough-going surveys for grain
collection in 1941. The majority still used the old method of democratic
apportionment of taxes. In 1942 the grain collection gained from the experience
of the previous year. The regulations were revised again to bring them more
in line with reality. More thorough surveys were undertaken on the basis
of the surveys carried out in 1941. The Finance Department issued instructions
that the cadres collecting the grain had to follow the regulations. In cases
where carrying out the regulations meant that the task could not be completed,
they could also use the method of democratic apportionment of taxes. At the
same time, during this collection the cadres were given ideological education
which overcame their previously crude work-style and backward conduct such
as following personal preferences and holding things back. According to recent
reports from Longdong there is once again proof of the importance of
thorough-going surveys for the implementation of regulations. One district
in Qingyang county carried out a thorough survey, and because much new land
was cultivated during the year and production increased, it was able to exceed
the original collection target by several hundred <B><I>tan </I></B>in line
with the regulations.
<P>
A further point to consider is that for several years the figures set for
the grain collection have been achieved and exceeded, but the work of putting
the grain into the granaries has been too muddled. Many cadres involved in
grain collection think that they only have to meet the target. They do not
consider quality or investigate delayed payments. As a result on one hand
the quality is not good enough with 15 to 20 per cent consisting of husks
in some cases, and on the other there are instances where the masses delay
in paying their grain. There is a difference between the amount collected
and the amount put into the granaries. In the 1941 collection, although the
quality was a bit better, there were still a lot of husks mixed with the
grain. The slogan 'Grain to the Granary and Hay to the Cellar' was put forward
to overcome the problem of late payment but there was still too much of it.
In addition, because the 1941 collection was much bigger than any previous
year, the difficulties of getting it into the granaries were much greater.
As a result over 3,900 <B><I>tan</I></B> of the grain collected did not go
into the granaries. This was nearly 2 per cent of the total. During the 1942
collection the problem of getting the grain into the granaries was specially
emphasized. According to the latest examination this work has been done a
little better this year. However, the question of whether the full total
had been put in the granaries or not awaits a final summary before it can
be answered.
<P>
Another point is that for several years the Finance Department has assigned
work groups to help the county and district governments in the grain-levy
work. Where county and district cadres are too weak, this method is of great
help. Its shortcoming is that it easily creates dependency in the lower-levels
of government, and every time there is a mobilization, the upper levels have
to send people. The cadres have to go back and forth, spending much time
on the road, which leads to waste of manpower and of time. Since collection
in 1942 had the good foundation of work done in 1941, the Finance Department
adopted the principle of 'fewer and better' in its assignment of work teams.
It sent fewer cadres to each county and increased the responsibility of the
county and district government. In 1941, 150 people were sent down. On this
basis they are preparing to move towards not sending down anyone at all,
handing all the grain collection work over to the county and district
governments.
<P>
As regards supply work, because general income and expenditure was not firmly
controlled in 1941 so that grain had to be bought once and borrowed twice,
and because mobilization were hurried and almost cruel, the masses were not
satisfied. This was a great shortcoming. In 1942 we were able to control
income and expenditure. we also had the 200,000 <B><I>tan</I></B> of grain
levied in 1941 as a guarantee to ensure supplies until December. However,
since the drive for better troops and simpler administration was not thorough,
the budget could not be strictly implemented. Occasional expenditures combined
with unpaid grain tax came to over 18,000 <B><I>tan</I></B>. In addition,
troop movements influenced the relationship between supply and demand in
various places, and grain balances in the first half of 1942 could not be
maintained as allocated. Therefore, after July places like Yan'an, Nanniwan
and Linzhen one after another became short of grain. Afterwards the Finance
Department issued supplementary funds of 2 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> to
buy grain and a summer collection was made. Only in this way was a grain
panic avoided during 1942, and there was no bad effect on the masses. Next,
for the grain in 194 we adopted the method of 'allocation as a whole and
divide' administration'. Although this saved the bother and waste of transport
to and fro, it brought about cases of uncontrolled selling of grain, which
also entailed a lot of waste. There was still a gap between the amount collected
and the amount needed for supplies, which also led to many shortcomings.
For example the grain and hay allocated to the various counties in 1941 was
biased towards the harvest situation and neglected the supply and demand
situation. The grain requirement in Sanbian for the year was over 10,000
<B><I>tan</I></B> but only 1,600 <B><I>tan</I></B> was collected. A supplement
of 9,000 <B><I>tan</I></B> had to be transported from Longdong, Ansai, Zichang,
Zhidan and so forth. Not only was the year's grain transport work excessive
for the masses of these counties, but the masses in Sanbian were also very
busy handling transshipment. They called out that 'this way is not as good
as collecting more from us'. It is now estimated that just the 4,000
<B><I>tan</I></B> of grain moved to Sanbian from Longdong cost 7 million
<B><I>yuan</I></B> to transport, which is more than the cost of buying grain
in Sanbian. Another example was the grain collected in Yanchuan. Originally
it should have supplied Yan'an. However in 1941 grain from Dongyang district
was collected at the Majiapan granary which is on the opposite side of the
county near the Yellow River. As a result it took an extra three days to
transport the grain to Yan'an. Quite a few similar situations arose in other
counties. Again, the plan for the 1941 hay collection was not thoroughly
researched. It was decided everywhere to collect the hay after the grain
and no attention was paid to supply and demand. As a result some places kept
hay for which there was no use and it was allowed to go rotten which dissatisfied
the masses. In other places which needed a lot of hay there was an exceptional
shortage and supplies were only enough for eight months. Another example
was the 1941 grain collection in Guanzhong. Millet was made the unit instead
of wheat. The peasants had to go out of the Border Region tp sell wheat and
buy millet in order to pay the tax. As a result too much millet was collected,
the troops were not used to eating it and there were many disputes. After
summer begins millet rots easily which added to the troubles. Again in 1941
the relative proportion between regular and miscellaneous grains was generalized,
and not reckoned according to the grain production circumstances or the
relationship between supply and demand in each place. As a result some places
(such as the special military area ) collected a lot of miscellaneous grain
which could not be issued. Some places (such as Yan'an) needed horse fodder
but could not get miscellaneous grains. The official organizations had to
lower the relative proportions and exchange hulled grain for miscellaneous
grain which in turn led to waste of grain. The above shortcomings illustrate
that grain work is very concrete and meticulous, practical work. If it is
done crudely and in a way divorced from reality then the results will disturb
the people and disrupt the government. In 1942 after the grain collection
work was handed over to the Grain Office, the management of grain collection
and supplying was united. At the same time as a means of balancing resources,
it was decided to accept a money substitute for the hay tax according to
the different supply-and-demand situation in each place. As for the relative
proportions of grains, the earlier way of generalized application was changed
into a system of deciding according to the concrete situation in each place,
thus overcoming the previous shortcoming.
<P>
Next, from the winter of 1941 up to the present quite large successes have
been achieved in setting up and consolidating systems for grain supply. As
regards the budget system, for example, in 1942 most official organizations
were able to draw up their budgets at the correct time. They have got rid
of the bad practices of claiming excess grain and eating double rations,
and corrected the situation where counties approved budgets haphazardly and
spent grain without control. In particular they have grasped the policy of
'the final account must not exceed the budget'. During 1942 they have
conscientiously cut down on all irrational expenditure, economizing on over
19,000 <B><I>tan </I></B>of grain. As regards the system for paying out grain,
most army units and official organizations have honoured the regulations
that grain cannot be paid out without a grain payment document. The responsible
comrades in the counties have also paid attention to this regulation. They
have not indiscriminately permitted loans from tax grain. At the same time
during 1942 all the counties have used the official <B><I>tou</I></B> measure
which considerably reduced the number of disputes. As for the granary
regulations, because of the cadres' limitations, these could only be strengthened
first in the central granaries and then gradually generalized to all granaries.
For keeping accounts, the Finance Department drew up two standard account-books
(one new-style and detailed, the other very simple) which were adopted by
the cadres according to their ability. In 1942 most granaries, good and bad,
had account-books. Gradually we can reach the goal of being able to obtain
at any time statistics for grain income, expenditure and the amounts and
kinds of grain in store. As for the grain coupon regulations, there was much
corruption in 1941 because we issued large numbers of coupons. In 1942 we
abandoned the old grain coupons and issued three kinds of meal-ticket which
were only supplied for circulation among personnel in the official organizations
to cover meals. This was a step forward.
<P>
However, there were still many defects in the grain-supply work. For example,
a minority of large units still could not draw up their budget at the stipulated
time. A comparison of the actual personnel totals and the budgets of various
large units showed that there was still quite a proportion of figures without
foundation. Some instances of taking double rations still occurred. The ratio
of livestock was not clearly laid down, which in some cases led to quite
a lot of waste. Instances of individual troop units insisting on grain loans
from granaries because they had wasted grain and overspent could still not
completely be avoided. As for the storage system, most granaries still only<B>
</B>managed to do the work of receiving and paying out grain and of
administration. They were not good enough at supervising collection,
safe-keeping, submitting accounts and other duties. The meal-tickets could
not be circulated among the people, which caused problems for personnel sent
to do outside tasks. This too was a shortcoming. Finally, there was a great
defect in building up and consolidating all regulations which was that the
Grain Office only emphasized its own regulations and difficulties. It could
not comprehensively and concretely concern itself with solutions to the problems
and difficulties facing each official organizations.
<P>
In 1942 the official organizations in charge of grain were very successful
in the work of clearing up the granaries' old grain accounts. For several
years the county grain accounts had not been examined and reckoned up, so
that the Grain Office's accounts were no longer any use. For example, according
to the Office's accounts, in the winter of 1941, Ansai should have had over
2,900 <B><I>tan </I></B>in store. In fact it had less than 100
<B><I>tan</I></B>. Again the account for the grain taken from the granary
by the sanitarium had not been worked out for five years. It was discovered
in 1942 that it had collected over 100 <B><I>tan </I></B>too much. There
were many cases like these. Compounded by the muddle over purchases and loans
in 1941, many counties had no accounts to be examined. As a result the Grain
Office sent cadres down to each place to work out the accounts and adopted
all kinds of accounting methods. The old granary accounts were only cleared
up after six months' hard work. Now the Grain Office is able to work out
how much grain is actually held by the granaries and can keep a hold on grain
income and expenditure. The counties' administration of grain was also previously
very poor with losses<B> </B>due to a combination of rats, insects, rotting
and so forth. In addition there was serious corruption among the cadres.
During grain<B> </B>collection in 1941, there were more than ten cases. It
had even gone so far that individual special agents had infiltrated granary
work. For example, Zhang Bingquan, the director of the granary of Taile district
in Fuxian, was a special agent. In February 1942 he embezzled over 10
<B><I>tan </I></B>of public grain and fled<B> </B>from the Border Region.
This shows that previously the Grain<B> </B>Office's supervision of granary
cadres was too lax and its inspection work too infrequent. Since the granary
accounts were cleared up in 1942 and the leadership of the granaries by the
five sections of government at county level was strengthened, corruption
and waste have been reduced and many active and<B> </B>hardworking cadres
have been discovered.
<P>
In carrying out collection policy in the two years 1939 and 1940 the regulations
were fixed so that the tax threshold began at 1.2 <B><I>tan </I></B>(that
is, peasant families whose harvest per person was less than 1.2 <B><I>tan
</I></B>were not taxed). Tax was progressively applied to a top level of
36 per cent (that is, the tax rate increased until it leveled 36 per cent
of the harvest and thereafter the percentage did not increase). The failing
here was that the tax burden was biased towards the minority of the well-off.
At the same time the method of collection was that of democratic apportionment
of taxes and not that laid down by the regulations. As a result, there were
cases of going for big households' and 'ignoring everything but the target'.
Also the collection policy was influenced by excessive 'Leftism. 1941 the
regulations were revised. The tax threshold was fixed at 0,5 <B><I>tan
</I></B>(for example, a family of five whose annual harvest of regular grain
was less than 2.5 <B><I>tan </I></B>was not taxed). Taxation was progressively
applied up to 30 per cent. The implementation of these regulations resulted
in a broadening of the base for collection. Apart from Huanxian which suffered
natural disasters, the tax burden in all other counties was carried by over
80 per cent of the people and in Yan'an county it reached 95 per cent. In
terms of carrying for the interests of all classes and strata, with the exception
of Yan'an, Yanchang and Ansai, the burden in other counties did not exceed
30 per cent of the harvest. However, there were still shortcomings. For example,
the counties were not entirely rational in their allocations to meet the
total collection. The special military area lowered the tax threshold to
0.3 <B><I>tan </I></B>and reduced the number of steps in the tax progression.
As a result the poor and middle peasants suffered and the richer middle peasants
and above were let off too lightly Also, during grain collection in 1941
we only paid attention to collecting grain and not to reducing rents and
interest rates at the same time. Some new immigrants who should not have
paid tax had to do so. Family dependants of troops in the War of Resistance
should have received special assistance but this was stopped in some cases.
Some cotton-growers should not have been taxed for grain but were. All these
things contravened the government's pollicies. Other policies such as caring
for the interests of all strata, raising the enthusiasm or production of
the peasants and so forth merely remained general slogans. Actual implementation
was very deficient. With the experience of 1941, the grain collection in
1942 made some advances. However, we still did not pay enough attention to
the cotton-growing policy. For example, the allocation of a quota for grain
tax to the cotton-growing areas in the three eastern counties was the same
as that allocated to other counties. When it came to collection, problems
arose. If grain tax was not collected on the cotton fields the requirement
could not be fulfilled. Yet if it was collected, it would conflict with
government orders. Ultimately they had to make accommodations and reduce
the collection by half. This still damaged the authority of the government.
<P>
In any work, going beyond policies depends on whether the cadres are good
or bad. Grain work is no exception. The most hardworking people doing grain
work are the granary cadres. The easiest corrupted are also the granary cadres.
Therefore we shall here specially quote examples of typically good and typically
bad granary cadres, so that everyone can learn from the good and be warned
by the bad.
<h4>
GOOD EXAMPLES</h4>
<P>
(A) Comrade He Chuango, director of Panlong granary is an old fellow of
fifty-two. He does not say much but is very careful and thoughtful, enthusiastic
and hardworking. In 1939 he was assigned to work in the Zhenwudong granary
of the Grain Office. In 1940 he was transferred to be director of the Panlong
granary, concurrently responsible for the grain-market balancing station
<I>[<B>diaojizhan</B>] </I>and the transport station. He is responsible for
the work of three men. In the past he has been secretary of a district Party
committee and has been trained at the Border Region Party School. Initially
he was one of seven people including Jia Zhicai and Ren Shengbiao who were
assigned from the Border Region Party School to do grain work but of these
he alone remains at his post today. His cultural level is not among the lowest
of the granary directors. He can write simple letters and keep clear accounts.
He is very conscientious in studying the newly adopted account books and
learns quickly. In 1941 when the 'monthly report tables' were issued to the
granaries some directors could not understand after three days of explanation.
After hearing once he was able to raise questions and opinions. After a few
questions like 'What should be filled in on this section?, Would it be all
right to fill in that section like this?', he could complete and send in
his 'monthly report tables' on time. Many fine qualities are expressed in
his work. The first is meticulous attention to detail. When receiving grain
he writes a receipt for the amount and makes up his accounts every evening.
When paying-out he double-checks on the abacus. The second is a deep sense
of responsibility. He takes great care of the granary. One storage bin was
a little damp and he paid special attention. He often had the grain spread
out to dry in the sun, and when paying-out grain he always paid from this
bin first. Eventually he dug a ditch behind the bin and dug the surface of
the earth around the bin lower than the bin, making it a little drier. When
the granary needs minor repairs he does not hire workers but sets-to himself
to carry bricks and plaster ( under his influence the personnel in charge
of moving the grain also work hard and help). As administrator of the transport
depot, every time a transport team arrives he helps to cut grass, draw water
and prepare food. His third quality is his friendly attitude to others. Some
of the personnel in leading official organizations get in a bad temper when
the grain is paid-out, but he patiently finishes the job and does not get
into arguments. Sometimes some of the masses send bad grain when paying-in.
He just encourages them to take it back. When buying grain to balance the
market, he can discuss things and get close to the masses. But he also has
his own opinions. Once when it was raining and the grain in the market could
not be sold, he took the opportunity to purchase it. The price was fairly
low and the masses were still pleased. For these reasons he enjoys some prestige
among the masses of Panlong. When receiving tax grain in 1941 a peasant from
Yongping district county offered him bribes. He got angry and sent the man
and the goods to the district government. His fourth quality is a plain and
simple way of life. He raises very few questions about his own life and he
expresses concern about receiving welfare expenses. In 1942 he was responsible
for collecting 4.000 <B><I>tan </I></B>of tax grain and everyone was concerned
that he might not manage since he is old and has few helpers. But every time
he wrote a letter to the Grain Office, he said that he could manage.
<P>
(B) Comrade Bai Heming is director of the Tianzhuang granary in Suide. He
is a graduate of upper primary school. He had worked in the old
<B><I>baojia</I></B> office. His qualities include first a deep sense of
responsibility. When receiving grain he compares receipts and invoices every
evening to make sure that there has been no mistake. He also makes out clear
accounts for households owing grain, and supervises the districts and townships,
encouraging them to send in their grain. Before receiving grain, he himself
lays stones and boards in the storage bins, spreads dry straw and puts straw
mats over the straw so as to guard against dampness. After the grain is in
store, he himself seals up the bins which will not be opened soon, using
bricks and plaster and covering-up holes which let in the wind, with broken
mats. Secondly, he is friendly towards others. When receiving grain he inspects
conscientiously. However, to those who send in bad grain he simply says:
'Look everybody, can you feel easy about sending grain like this for the
troops?' He has never raised his voice in abuse. If someone from the army
came to collect grain not in accordance with official procedures, he always
courteously and patiently explained things. On the one hand he would lend
some grain to prevent shortage, and on the other asked the them to make good
the procedures. Before long if anyone from the troops stationed in Suide
went to collect grain from old Bai's granary, they always went through the
procedures to avoid difficulties for old Bai and embarrassment for themselves.
Thirdly, he is very hardworking. He gathers firewood and draws water himself.
He is careful over operating and food costs. He reports excess expenditure
to the fifth government section at county level. He does not indiscriminately
take grain and sell it for the cash to make up deficiencies. Now Comrade
Bai Heming has been promoted to be head of the fifth section of Suide county
government.
<h4>
BAD EXAMPLES</h4>
<P>
(A) Hy Dianchang was director of the granary of Fourth district Xinning.
When receiving grain in the winter of 1941, he sold 3 <B><I>tan
</I></B>privately, took 1.3 <B><I>tan </I></B>home, and lent 3.92 <B><I>tan
</I></B>to his relatives and friends. He himself and his relatives and friends,
Hy Diangong, Hu Qingrong and Liu Zixiao should have paid 7 <B><I>tan
</I></B>of grain tax. They did not hand over a single grain but he still
issued tax-grain receipts. When receiving grain he did not allow the masses
to sweep up the grain on the floor, but swept it up himself and shared it
with the personnel helping him to receive the grain. After he had finished
issuing tax-grain for deposit in citizens' homes, he was 0.2 <B><I>tan
</I></B>short but he falsely reported 1 <B><I>tan </I></B>to the fifth section
of the county government. After the fifth section found him out, he was sent
to court, sentenced to prison and ordered to return the embezzled grain.
<P>
(B) In September 1939 after grain was sold from the Shuifan district granary
in the Huachi county, 14.7 <B><I>tan </I></B>of tax grain was missing. The
granary director, Wang Wenbin reported to the upper levels that rats had
eaten 12.7 <B><I>tan </I></B>and another 2 <B><I>tan </I></B>had been
contaminated. In 1941 when the grain collection work group went to investigate,
they discovered that Wang Wenbin had gone to the county town for a meeting
during the time when the grain was sold. His place had been taken by the
district secretary Mao Yupeng. During the grain sales Mao Yupeng had lived
exceptionally richly. He had bought a flock of sheep and two skin coats.
He had also bought cloth. There was suspicion of embezzlement. However, at
the time the county government did not investigate. Afterwards Mao Yupeng
was transferred to work elsewhere. This affair is still going on.
<P>
Above we have summed up our experience in grain work during the past five
years. Below are the policies for work in 1943.
<P>
(1) Implement the unified progressive agricultural tax. In the past we have
used the method of levying national salvation grain tax. It is not an entirely
satisfactory method of taxation. If it is well done it can only achieve the
aim of being fair burden on the people. It cannot give any effective
encouragement to the peasants' feelings towards production. Therefore we
must actively prepare to implement the unified progressive agricultural tax.
How should our preparatory work be done? (i) Under the leadership of the
Finance Department set up a specialist research team consisting of five to
seven cadres selected for their experience in political work and their good
understanding of land and financial problems. This team should gather, study
and arrange materials concerning progressive taxation, and plan the work
for introducing it. In addition, directed by the Border Region Government,
responsible comrades from the relevant official organizations led by the
head of the Finance Department should organize a planning committee to take
charge of policy, to solve problems and to regularly lead the work of the
research team. (ii) Carry out survey work. A detailed summary of grain collection
work in 1942 should be supplied to the progressive taxation research team
as concrete source material. The research team should first study some counties
with different situations, whose collection in 1941 and 1942 was comparatively
good. They should draw up an initial survey plan, and first carry out trial
surveys. Afterwards they should revise the plan, draw up a format and carry
out a general survey. In the light of the materials from the survey they
should determine the regulations and methods. Counties with good successes
who complete the work early can carry out a trial run during 1943. (iii)
Carry out land registration at the same time as the surveys. (iv) Strengthen
the government organization at township level, build up sound clerical records
and survey thoroughly.
<P>
(2) Grasp grain and hay, ensure supplies. Supplying grain and hay is complex
and detailed work. Grain and hay resources are widespread and not easily
grasped. If we are unable to pay full attention at all times and cannot suitably
adjust the relationship between supply and demand, it will be hard to make
a good job of it. If we want to be able to grasp grain and hay and ensure
supplies, we must do the following: (i) We must first ensure that all the
160,000 <B><I>tan</I></B> enters the granaries, and improve the quality so
that 100 per cent is grain. Do not allow adulteration with husks. At the
same time, call on all counties to eliminate evasion of payment. We must
build up thorough regulations for the administration of grain and hay. Pay
attention to the running and inspection of granaries. Set up central granaries.
Gradually improve equipment. Prevent damage through contamination and rotting,
and corruption and theft. Strictly carry out the budget system. Completely
eradicate excessive claims and taking double rations. Set up grain accounts
in accordance with the cultural level of the cadres in each place. Do not
be too elaborate but require that receipts, issues and stocks of grain are
clearly recorded. Next, the regulations for paying-out grain are even more
important and must be carried out. The reason for building up regulations
soundly is to ensure supplies and to prevent corruption and waste. All instances
of not adhering to discipline must be strictly corrected. However, a mechanical
viewpoint which one-sidedly emphasizes regulations without concern for the
concrete facts must also be guarded against. (ii) To ensure supplies, we
must first handle the relationship between supply and demand of grain and
hay. Prepare supplements for areas deficient in grain through transport,
adjustment of distribution and so forth. In 1943 we should organize any unused
animals owned by the official organizations to transport grain and hay, improve
the work efficiency of every transport team (on average our animals each
carry 1 <B><I>tou</I></B> less than those of the common folk and we need
three days to go as far as they do in two) and lay down precise transport
tasks so as to economize on manpower and animal power which can then be used
for production. We must depend on the grain transported by the people, making
plans early and using the slack agricultural periods and unused porters and
animals. Except in special circumstances, mobilizing transport in the busy
agricultural seasons is not allowed. Long distance transport must also be
avoided as much as possible. In areas where the distribution of grain can
be adjusted, coordinated plans should be made by the Grain Office. Grain
should be sold or bought at the right times so as to supplement supplies,
save on transport and avoid waste. In areas where official organizations
and schools are excessively concentrated such as Yan'an, we should consider
the situation, and disperse men and horses to ease the distribution of grain
and straw.
<P>
(3) Carry out the drive for better troops and simpler administration, store
grain to prepare for famine. For successive years the Border Region has overdrawn
its tax grain and has not got the slightest reserve. If natural disaster
occurred, grain supplies for the army and people would become an extremely
serious problem. Everyone should be warned by this to take the following
steps: (i) Resolutely carry out the new reorganization plan of the Party
and government and the drive for better troops and simpler administration.
Through simplification and strict economy ensure a balance between grain
income and income and expenditure in 1943. (ii) Collect 180,000
<B><I>tan</I></B> of' tax grain in 1943 so that we have a chance to retain
some as reserve against need. (iii) During 1943 the troops, official
organizations and schools should put developing agriculture in first place.
Growing grain should form a considerable proportion of farming work so that
there will be an even greater surplus in 1944 and we will be prepared against
disaster. The troops, official organizations and schools certainly may not
relax their own grain production because we are preparing to levy 180,000
<B><I>tan</I></B> during 1943.
<P>
(4) Strive to economize, strictly prevent waste of grain. There is a serious
waste of grain among the official organizations and troops. Thus, mounting
a campaign to economize should be one of our central tasks for 1943. Recently
in Yan'an some of official organizations and schools have inspected the amount
of waste and carried out economy campaigns with great success. For example,
the administrators of a training squad in the supply department of the garrison
forces were diligent and responsible. When issuing grain and flour, they
did the weighing themselves. Thus their food supply was just right and they
were often able to eat buns and noodles. The Central Party School has large
kitchens. Recently administration of food has been strict. Grain-cooking
has been supervised. Left-over grain has been kept and eaten as the following
meal. After this was done, only 1 <B><I>jin</I></B> of millet was consumed
per head per day. Before a month was up more than 5 <B><I>tan</I></B> of
'millet was saved. Another example was the collective meals at the nursery.
In the past when the people there took meals in separate groups, the nursery
consumed 150<B><I> jin </I></B>of flour a meal. After collective meals were
introduced, they only consumed 100 <B><I>jin</I></B> saving one-third. You
see, comrades, what a surprising amount this is. Similarly the central
departments and committees have implemented collective mess-halls and have
also got good results. The Central Party School planned in the first half
of the year to raise 2,000 chickens which required 300 bowls of millet a
day. The waste was quite large. Afterwards they killed most of the chickens
and only sixty were left. This saved quite a lot of grain. In addition, it
is necessary to foster the habit of using meal-tickets. It can reduce the
issue of large amounts of grain. In sum, in order to ensure that there are
absolutely no shortages of grain, on the one hand we must levy and produce
it and on the other we must seek to economize. This is the work for leading
comrades and it is a mass-movement. Everyone must pay attention and complete
the task given by the Party.
