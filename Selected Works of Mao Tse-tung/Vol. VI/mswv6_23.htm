  LETTER TO THE SPANISH PEOPLE
</H1>
<p class="title">
May 15, 1937
<P class="information">
[<I>Extracted from a letter dated 15 May 1937, published in Chieh-fang, no.

<p>
People of Spain, Comrades in arms:
<p>
We, the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Red Army, and the Chinese Soviets,
regard the war fought by the Spanish Republican Government as the most sacred
war in the world. This war is being waged not only for the life of the Spanish
people, but also for the oppressed peoples of the world, because the Spanish
Government is resisting German and Italian fascism, which, with their Spanish
accomplices. are destroying the culture, civilization, and justice of the
world. The Spanish Government and the Spanish people are fighting the German
and Italian fascists, who are in league with and giving support to the Japanese
facial invaders of China in the Far East...Were it not for the support
received from German and Italian fascism, Japanese fascism could not, as
it is now doing attack us like a mad dog...
<p>
We do not believe that the struggle of the Chinese people can be separated
from your struggle in Spain. The Communist Party of China is supporting and
encouraging you, the Spanish people, by struggling against Japanese fascism.
The Communist Party of China, the Chinese Soviets, the Chinese Red Army,
and the Chinese people are greatly moved by your defence of Madrid and by
your victories on the northern and southern fronts. Each day our press here
in the Soviet regions publishes reports and articles about your heroic
struggle... We firmly believe that the unity of your various parties in the
People's Front is the basis for your final victory...
<p>
We know that your victory will directly aid us in our fight against Japanese
fascism. Your cause is our cause. We read with emotion of the International
Volunteers organized by people from every land, and we are glad that there
are Chinese and Japanese in their ranks. Many comrades of the Chinese Red
Army also wish to go to Spain to join you. . . Were it not that we are face
to face with the Japanese enemy, we would join you and take our place in
your front ranks.
<p>
As many of you know, the Chinese Red Army has carried on a ceaseless and
hard struggle for ten years. We fought without resources, through hunger
and cold, with insufficient arms, ammunition, and medical supplies, until
at last we won our victories. We know that you and your army are also passing
through great hardships such as we also have passed through, and we are certain
that you will be victorious. Our ten years' struggle has proved that if a
revolutionary people and their revolutionary army are not afraid of suffering,
but continue to fight heroically and unyieldingly against the enemy, they
will be victorious &#133;
