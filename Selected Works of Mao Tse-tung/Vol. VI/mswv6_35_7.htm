  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE ANTI-JAPANESE WAR
</h1>
<P>
<h4>
  7. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-SUPPORTING INDUSTRY
</h4>
<P>
The agriculture, animal husbandry, handicraft industry, cooperatives and
salt industry discussed above are all economic undertakings by the people.
The Party and government give guidance and help within the bounds of possibility
and need so that these things can develop and the requirements of the people
can be met. At the same time, the portion handed over to the government by
the people in the form of taxes ensures a part of the government's needs
(for example, grain tax, salt tax and other taxes ) and the portion handed
over in the form of trade ensures another part of the government's needs
(for example, raw cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, wool, etc.). Their basic
nature is that of undertakings run by the people. Only in the case of the
salt industry, where 40,000 packs of salt are transported and sold under
the control of the government's Salt Company and the 5,000 or so packs are
consumed directly by government personnel, does a part (about one-seventh
of the whole) belong to the public sector of the economy.
<P>
As a whole the undertakings of the public Sector of the economy consist of
the following three kinds: (1) the salt industry, industry and commerce run
by the government; (2) the agriculture, industry and commerce run by the
army; and (3) the agriculture, industry and commerce of the official organization
of the Party and government. These all directly ensure the supply of the
living and other expenses of the Party, government and army personnel. According
to accounts for 1942 and the budget for 1943, the amount supplied in this
way exceeds the amount handed over by the people in the form of taxes (including
the grain tax ) . Therefore publicly-run economic undertaking have become
the greater of the two large sources ensuring financial supplies. Their
importance cannot be overstated.
<P>
The reasons we pay attention to publicly-run economic construction are both
historical and contemporary. During the civil war, the Party Central established
some publicly-run industry and commerce in the Jiangxi Soviet in order to
meet the need of the war. At that time, we initiated the growing of vegetable
and raising of pigs by the various official organizations and schools so
as to make up for the lack of provisions. Only the army did not have experience
in production. Also, since the peasants of Jiangxi were comparatively rich
and numerous, it was not yet necessary for us ourselves to set-to to provide
grain. These are historical reasons. Since the War of Resistance began, we
have found ourselves in a very special situation. At first the Kuomintang
provided a very small amount of ratio for our arms. Subsequently, it cut
them off entirely. The Border Region was blockaded, leaving us no alternative,
but to become self-supporting in supplying the needs of the War of Resistance.
These are contemporary reasons.
<P>
After the War of Resistance began, attention was turned to publicly-run economic
construction in 1938. Since we could not cover the costs of our army we began
a production movement. However, at that time we only ordered some of the
troops to take part in production, growing vegetables, raising pigs, cutting
wood, making shoes and so forth on a trial basis. The aim was simply to rely
on this as a way of improving the livelihood of the soldiers. We still did
not plan to rely on it as a way of providing general finance and supplies.
Later we saw how successful the soldiers were in this experiment. They could
do a lot of productive work during their rests from training, and their living
standards really improved. After this happened there was a reduction in the
instances of desertion. On seeing this success, we applied the experience
widely among the troops garrisoned in the Border Region. An order was issued
from the Garrison Office <I>[liushouchu] </I>calling on the troops to learn
from this example. But we still aimed at improving livelihood and not at
meeting general needs. At that time, the<B> </B>government started to pay
attention to setting up several small factories but the official organizations
and schools were not even called on to grow vegetables and raise pigs. In
1939, the Kuomintang issued the <B><I>Methods to Restrict the Activities
of Alien Parties</I></B> and relations between the Kuomintang and the Communist
Party worsened. The number of official organizations and schools in the Border
Region also increased. Although there was a small amount of subsidy for expenses
from outside, it was already far from sufficient. We were facing a serious
situation in finance and supplies. For these reasons we were forced to devise
a movement for all-round mobilization to become economically self-supporting.
We then raised the following questions at the congress for cadre mobilization.
Do you want to starve to death? Shall we disband? Or shall we set-to ourselves?
No one approved of starving to death, and no one approved of disbanding.
Let us set-to ourselves &#151; this was our answer. We pointed out this simple
principle: in the final analysis, how did ancient man survive if not by getting
down to it himself? Why is it that we, the sons and grandsons of these ancient
men, do not even have this spark of intelligence? We also pointed out: it
is very common for an exploited peasant household in a feudal society with
three or four or even seven or eight mouths to feed to rely on the production
of only one labour power. Such a family must not only support itself but
must also pay 50 to 80 per cent of its income in rent and taxes to others.
Why are we not as good as such a family? Our army is made up entirely of
labour power, there are no women, no old and young. Nor is there the burden
of rent and taxes. How could hunger arise? We have these powerful organs
of government. Why cannot they provide their own clothing, food, housing
and equipment? We reflected for a while on the reasons why ancient man and
today's poor peasant were able to survive, and moreover to live better than
wild animals. Without doubt it was because each had a pair of hands, and
extended their hands using tools. We again considered ourselves. In fact
each of us has a pair of hands, and we can extend them with tools. This period
of reflection was very important. Thereafter our problems were immediately
solved. In sum we affirmed that we were able to overcome economic difficulties.
Our response to all problems in this respect were the three words 'set-to
ourselves'. This time the tasks we set were no longer the same as those of
1938. We no longer wanted merely to improve our livelihood, but also wanted
to meet some of our general needs. The scope of mobilization was not limited
to the army and we called on all forces, official organizations and schools
to carry out production. We implemented a call for a large-scale production
movement. <B><I>The Song of Opening up New Land</I></B> was a new song from
that period, and so was <B><I>The Production Chorus</I></B>. This call not
only mobilized the several tens of thousands of personnel in the Party,
government, army and schools, but also mobilized the common folk of the Border
Region. In that year the common folk opened up over 1 million
<B><I>mu</I></B> of new land. This call also<B> </B>reached all over north
China. Many units of the Eighth Route Army at the battlefront also carried
out production during breaks in the fighting. This was the first stage of
our movement for production self-sufficiency. This stage included the three
whole<B> </B>years of 1938, 1939 and 1940. During this stage the government's
industrial construction advanced and the army, official organizations and
schools developed agricultural production.
<P>
From 1941 until this Senior Cadres' Conference (December 1942) has been the
second stage. The foundation for self-supporting production had already been
firmly laid. During these two years, personnel increased and many people
unable to find enough to eat outside came to the Border Region seeking food.
The 359 Brigade also came to strengthen defences along the Yellow River.
The troops have grown in number and support<I> </I>from outside has completely
ceased. There are only two sources for the government's living and operating
expenses, the people and the government itself. As a result of two years'
hard work the proportion of the total amount coming from the government itself
is greater then that coming from the people. Experience during this stage
makes us feel grateful to those people who blockaded us. For the blockade
as well as having its negative drawbacks also brought about a positive side,
which was to encourage us to be determined to set-to ourselves. As a result
we achieved our goal of overcoming difficulties and trained experience in
running economic enterprises. The old saying 'hardship and distress help
you to success' is something we have come to understand entirely and consciously.
<P>
During the first of the two stages we have gone through, the troops, official
organizations and schools placed emphasis on agriculture and the government
developed industry. During the second stage we stressed commerce in order
to provide for the critical needs of the moment. With the exception of those
troops, official organizations and schools which persisted in the policy
of putting agriculture in a prime position, the rest developed business skills
and did not place such heavy emphasis on agriculture as in the first stage.
However, the government, troops, official organizations and schools all developed
industry and handicrafts. After this Senior Cadres' Conference we will enter
a new stage of development. In the new stage our economic base will already
be rather firm and our experience fairly wide. He should put agriculture
in first place, industry, handicrafts, transport and animal husbandry in
second place, and commerce in third place. Since commerce can only help in
an emergency, we cannot and should not attempt to lay a long-lasting foundation
upon it.
<P>
Distinctions between the government, the army, and the official organizations
and schools in the public sector of the economy can only be made in terms
of management and not in terms of an economic nature. Therefore in the following
discussion on self-supporting industry we shall treat the industry run by
all three as a whole, and when discussing the self-supporting economy of
the army and the official organizations and schools, we shall again look
at their industrial production separately. However, since industry run by
the government is the largest part of all publicly-run industry (government
textile mills produce 56 per cent of the 22,000 bolts of cloth produced annually
by all publicly-run textile mills; the output of government paper factories
is 70 per cent of all publicly-run paper production; the output of government
soap factories is 70 per cent of all Border Region soap production), it is
rational to deal with all self-supporting industry alongside that run by
the government.
<P>
Why should unified, self-supporting industry be run in such a dispersed way?
The main reason is that the labour force is divided among the various branches
of the Party, government and army. If it were centralized, we would destroy
their activism. For example, we encouraged 359 Brigade to set up the Daguang
Textile Mill and did not order it to combine with a government mill because
most of the several hundred employees at the mill were selected from the
officers and men of 359 Brigade. They work to produce the bedding and clothing
requirements of the Brigade and their enthusiasm is high. If we centralized,
we would destroy this enthusiasm. Another important reason for dispersed
operation is that raw materials are in many different locations and this
causes transport problems. For example, in order to meet the needs of the
Party, government and army personnel of Guanzhong, Longdong, Sanbian, and
Suide the bedding and clothing industry finds it best to produce cloth (or
buy it) on the spot, and to make it up on the spot. It certainly should not
concentrate its making up in Yan'an alone. Thus we use the activism of the
various branches to undertake production to meet their own needs. Adopting
the policy of 'dispersed operation' is correct and ideas aimed at centralizing
everything are wrong. However, enterprises of the same kind carried out within
the same area should be centralized as much as possible. Unlimited dispersal
is not profitable. At present we are already carrying out or about to carry
out centralization of this kind. One example is the handing over to government
control of the Tuanjie Textile Mill of the Central Committee's Central
Administration Bureau <B><I>[Zhonguang Guanliju]</I></B> and the Jiao-tong
Textile Mill of the Rear Services Department <I>[<B>honquinbu</B>]. </I>Perhaps
this process of dispersal at first and centralization later cannot be avoided.
Dispersal makes it possible to use the activism of various branches when
setting something up, and centralization enables the various branches to
get better supplies. But it is very important that dispersed management does
not lead to forgetting centralized leadership. This facilitates unified planning,
balanced supplies, and essential arrangements in rational management and
distribution. Up to now we have had great shortcomings in this respect and
they must be corrected in future. To sum up, our policy is 'centralized
leadership and dispersed operation'. Not only is industry like this, agriculture
and commerce are too.
<P>
At this point we must distinguish between two forms of publicly-run agriculture,
industry and commerce, the large and the small. Large should be centralized
and small should be dispersed. Examples of things for which we should encourage
dispersed operation include agricultural work such as growing vegetables,
raising pigs, cutting wood and making charcoal, and handicrafts such as
shoemaking, knitting, or small mills when both are run by one or more provision
units <B><I>[huoshi danwei]</I></B> to provide for their own daily food,
bedding and clothing needs and to make up deficiencies in running expenses;
or cooperatives and small-scale commerce operated to provide from consumption
costs or to earn a small profit to cover office expenses. These things must
be dispersed, being carried out and developed everywhere. They cannot be
centralized and should not be. This is one kind. However, there is another
kind. Examples of this are such things as large agricultural plans to provide
a definite amount of grain for a whole brigade or regiment of troops &#151;
that is the military farming <B><I>[tun tian]</I></B>plan; large agricultural
stations run to meet the grain and vegetable requirements of many official
organizations; large workshops and factories run to provide for the bedding,
clothing and daily requirements of a Whole brigade, a regiment, or a large
number of official organizations; and large-scale commerce run to meet the
operating costs of such large units. All these things must have a unified
plan, centralized control, and strict regulation of expenditure. We cannot
allow them to lack coordination and operate without restraint. However,
agriculture, industry and commerce which should be under centralized leadership
must not be put entirely in the hands of one single official organization
for the whole Border Region. Instead the unified plan drawn up by such an
official organization (at present the Border Region Finance and Economy Committee
and its office) according to the needs of the whole and the parts and the
possibilities for operation, is handed over to the Party, government and
army systems for separate implementation. Within the Party, government and
army systems, there is also a unified plan with division in operation. These
are the features of the policy of 'centralized leadership and dispersed
operation' in the publicly-run sector of the economy of the Border Region.
<P>
In the five years since 1938, the public sector of the economy has made some
very great achievements. These achievements are worth treasuring for ourselves
and for our nation. That is, we have established a new model for the national
economy. The reason that this is a new model is that it is neither the old
Bismarkian model of the national economy nor the new Soviet model of the
national economy but it is the national economy of the New Democracy or the
Three People's Principles.
<P>
Our publicly-run, self-supporting industry has not yet reached the stage
of supplying fully all our needs. We still cannot talk of using surplus capacity
to meet the needs of the people. As yet those needs can only be met by the
Party and government providing organizational stimulus and the people setting-to
themselves. At present all our efforts are aimed at meeting the needs of
self-sufficiency within two or three years, particularly the need for cotton
cloth. We must not indulge in the fantasy that in present circumstances we
can have tremendous development. That will only do harm.
<P>
Below I shall discuss our publicly-run economic undertakings over the past
five years item-by-item beginning with self-supporting industry.
<P>
We first began to pay attention to the construction of publicly-run industry
in 1938. In that year the Border Region successively established the Refugee
Textile Mills, the paper factory, the bedding and clothing factory, the
agricultural implements factory, and the Eighth Route Army medicine factory.
Later on most of these factories each provided an important stimulus. At
this time the industrialist Mr Shen Hong voluntarily moved his ten
privately-owned machines to the Border Region to serve the Eighth Route Army,
and Mr Shen himself came to the Border Region to work. Thereafter many scientific
and technical personnel also came to the Border Region to work, enabling
the Border Region to gather a pool of scientific and technical talent as
the guiding force in the establishment of industry.
<P>
In 1939 the blockade of the Border Region economy began. Imports of industrial
products were limited. The Party Central issued the calls to 'set-to ourselves'
and to be 'self-reliant'. After the Border Region Government held the
agricultural exhibition in January, it held an industrial exhibition on Labour
Day, which stimulated enthusiasm to develop industry. The government and
the Rear Services Department sent people to Si'an to select and buy machines
and materials. They also organized spinning and weaving cooperatives and
oil-pressing and tile-making producer cooperatives in Yan'an and Ansai. Although
the machines and materials bought from Si'an were insufficient, they became
one of the major material strengths in the development of Border Region industry
over the past few years. In that year we also set up the Xinghua Chemical
Factory and the Guanghua Medicine Factory, and began to explore the thick
coal-seams at Shilipu in Yan'an county.
<P>
The development of industry in 1940 was carried out under the policy of becoming
'semi-self-sufficient' in production. It was decided to make the development
of light industry the key feature. In January we held the second industrial
exhibition and reviewed the strength of our factories. The Border Region
Bank lent 1 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> to expand factory capital, to set
up proper factory sites and to continue buying materials. In February the
Central Committee put forward the policy of 'centralized leadership and dispersed
operation'. In September Commander Zhu promoted the wool-spinning movement
and developed some wool-spinning and weaving undertakings. Very many large
official organizations and schools and troop units planned actively to set
up factories. They sent people to existing factories to study techniques.
They studied methods of control and fixed plans for the rapid development
of industry in 1941.
<P>
In 1941 the Central Committee put forward the policy of 'moving from
semi-self-sufficiency to complete self-sufficiency'. Under this policy the
Bank increased its loan by 3 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> and the government
also invested 500,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> in the publicly-run factories. Many
official organizations and troop units also set aside funds to establish
factories. On the Eight of March Festival [International Woman's Day) we
held a production exhibition. In December the large Bank building was completed
and we held another industrial exhibition presided over by the Bank. The
following list gives the factories set up by the official organizations and
schools directly under the Central Committee in 1942 so as to show the efforts
made by the various units to develop industry at this time. These industries
are all handicraft factories, none large and some very small.
<P>
(1) The Xin Zhongguo Textile Mill, the Shiyan Factory, the wooden implements
factory, the carpentry factory, the first and second charcoal factories,
the tile factory, and the bedding and clothing factory run by the Finance
and Economy Office directly under the Central Committee. Total capital over
200,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. More than 220 employees.
<P>
(2) The Shengli Wool Factory and Shengli Carpentry Factory set up by the
Central Organization Department <B><I>[Zhonguang Zuzhibu].</I></B>
<P>
(3) The Qiyi Mill set up by the Central Propaganda Department
<B><I>[Zhonguang Xuanchuanbu].</I></B>
<P>
(4) The Tuanjie Textile Mill set up by the Marxism-Leninism Institute.
<P>
(5) The Sun Yat-sen Textile Mill set up by the Central Party School.
<P>
(6) The blanket factory, mill, alcohol factory, glass factory and machine
factory set up by the National Sciences Institute.
<P>
(7) The factories run by the Lu Hsun Academy, the North Shaanxi Public School
<B><I>[shaangong],</I></B> the Youth League cadres and the Women's University.
<P>
(8) The Xinhua Carpentry Factory and the bedding and clothing factory run
by the Central Printing and Publishing Department.
<P>
(9) The Yanyuan Paper Factory run by the instruction brigade <B><I>[jiaodao
dadui].</I></B>
<P>
The above lists twenty-seven factories run my the systems directly controlled
by the Central Committee with a total of 447 employees and more than 400,000
<B><I>yuan </I></B>capital. Most were set up with the aim of achieving economic
self-sufficiency.
<P>
These apart, there are several small factories run by the Economic Construction
Department <B><I>[Jingjianbu],</I></B> the Garrison Office, the Public Security
headquarters, the Border Region Finance and Economy Office, 359 Brigade and
various special offices. The Daguang Textile Mill of 359 Brigade has a fairly
large output. The various regiments of 359 Brigade also have their own
small-scale cotton or wool-spinning and weaving workshops.
<P>
The industry constructed from 1938 to 1941 is now expanding. Development
during 1941 was particularly vigorous and provided a foundation for the work
of 1942. However throughout the period construction was carried out rather
blindly. Many personnel lacked conscious awareness. They only thought of
the present and not of the future. They only thought of dispersed operation
and not of unified leadership. They had an entirely anarchic outlook. As
a result some factories closed down as soon as they were built, some announced
they were closing down after a short period of operation and some merged
with other factories. Only a portion of them have continued to exist. To
take textile enterprises near Yan'an, by 1942 only three large factories,
the Refugee, the Jiaotong and the Tuanjie and two small factories, the Xinghua
and the Gongyi remained. This winding path could not be avoided at the time,
since one can only gain experience from paths that one has already travelled.
But having gained experience from this stage, it would be better to avoid
following similar winding path in new industrial construction.
<P>
In 1942 the Reconstruction Department laid down the policy of consolidating
existing publicly-run factories and developing rural handicrafts. Government
investment in industry was 1,700,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Rural handicrafts
run by the people had already greatly expanded before this year. In Suide,
for example, there were 600-700 cotton cloth hand-looms. Blanket-making,
leather-tanning and ironwork had also developed in other places. The public
and private textile industry has developed particularly quickly and it has
a lot of problems. In order to ensure the development of the textile industry,
we have reduced the import tax on raw cotton and foreign yarn to 1 per cent
and increased the import tax on bolts of cloth to 15 percent. In Suide the
bank organized the 'the Yongchang Native Cloth Producing and Selling Company'
with capital of 2 million <B><I>yuan</I></B>. It issues raw cotton and collects
yarn and cloth, encouraging the peasant women to spin yarn and weave cloth.
Since cloth-weaving by peasant households has expanded, much of the cloth
produced by privately-run, small-scale, capitalist textile production
cooperatives can no longer be sold. They also have difficulties with the
supply of native yarn. They have no choice but to reduce their scope of
operation, or to become fragmented, distributing their equipment among the
people and transforming themselves into family subsidiaries. Since publicly-run
textile mills chiefly supply for public use, they can maintain themselves.
But they also have problems with the supply of raw cotton and yarn. This
year the Zhenhua main factory and branch factory of the publicly-run paper
industry completed the task of supplying the Publications Office with 3,000
rolls of paper made from <B><I>malan</I></B> grass. The Lihua first and second
factories originally planned to produce 2,500 rolls but did not succeed.
This year's output will not exceed 500 rolls. Other publicly-run paper factories
experience great difficulty since there is no market for their paper. The
products of the publicly-run woollen industry such as blankets are aimed
at solving problems of finance. The government does not use them itself.
Some are exported and others are sold to the troops. The fine-spun woollen
thread produced is particularly well received and brings a good profit. Beginning
in September, the Jiaotong, Xinghua and Tuanjie textile mills, and the first
and second Lihua paper factories were all handed over to the control of the
Border Region Government from the Central Committee and the Rear Services
Department systems. In order to ensure raw materials for spinning and weaving
in 1943, we have begun to buy cotton from the three eastern counties this
year. We plan to buy 750,000 <B><I>jin</I></B> . To ensure the supply of
raw materials for paper manufacture, we have raised a levy of 730,000
<B><I>jin</I></B> of <B><I>malan</I></B> grass from the counties of Ganquan,
Yan'an, Ansai, Anding, and so forth. The factories should wait until they
have carried out the policy of better workers and simpler administration
before dealing with the recruitment of personnel.
<P>
The year 1942, and particularly this Senior Cadres' Conference, is an important
landmark in beginning to get rid of blindness and anarchy, and for introducing
consciousness and unified and planned operation into the whole of the public
sector of the Border Region economy, and especially into publicly-run industry.
Although the Central Committee put forward the principle of 'centralized
leadership and dispersed operation' long ago in February 1940, only in 1942
has it attracted comrades' attention. It has only obtained unanimous acceptance
at this Senior Cadres' Conference. Five years of practical experience has
made us progress a lot. After this conference, the whole public sector, industry
included, must be reorganized so that it develops healthily.
<P>
Above I have given a simple outline of the history of industry in the Border
Region over the past five years. By December 1942 we have seven kinds of
industry: textiles, bedding and clothing, paper, printing, chemical, tools
and coal and charcoal. There are seven textile mills with 26,900,000
<B><I>yuan </I></B>capital and 1,427 employees; eight bedding, clothing and
shoe factories with l,001,100 <B><I>yuan </I></B>capital and 405 employees;
twelve paper factories with 4,100,000 <B><I>yuan </I></B>capital and 437
employees; three printing factories with 5,200,000 <B><I>yuan </I></B>capital
and 379 employees; twelve chemical factories (medicine, soap, leather, pottery,
petrol, etc. ) with 17,030,000 <B><I>yuan </I></B>capital and 674 employees;
nine tool factories with 3,662,792 <B><I>yuan </I></B>capital and 237 employees:
and twelve coal and charcoal factories with 1,777,070 <B><I>yuan
</I></B>capital and 432 employees. The total figures are sixty-two factories
with 59,670,962 <B><I>yuan </I></B>capital and 3,991 employees. Although
our industry is still very small and mainly takes the form of handicrafts
with not much machine industry, nevertheless it has taken five years of effort,
laid down an initial foundation and played a part in ensuring supplies and
regulating commodity prices. Developing from this foundation, it can certainly
plan an even greater role.
<P>
Our most important self-supporting industries are the textile industry and
the bedding and clothing industry. These are what the several tens of thousands
of troops and personnel in the official organizations and schools rely upon
each year for their cloth, bedding and clothing. Without them we would be
frozen. In 1942 our textile industry was already capable of producing over
22,000 bolts of cloth. However we needed 40,000-50,000 bolts and we can only
reach our goal of self-sufficiency through great efforts. If we want to develop
textiles, we must carry out the following policies.
<P>
(1) We must raise cotton-cloth import duty and protect native cloth. At the
same time, the troops and official organizations and schools must use only
native cloth produced in the Border Region.
<P>
(2) We must generally encourage peasant women to spin cotton yarn and woollen
thread to guarantee supplies of yarn and thread to the factories. At the
same time, we can raise the income of the masses.
<P>
(3) We must solve problems of supply and distribution. No matter whether
publicly-run, privately-run or family subsidiary, the ability to develop
is chiefly related to whether problems of supply and distribution can be
solved. As regards raw materials, we are still not self-sufficient in raw
cotton and cotton yarn, and the sources are not dependable. Since communications
are not very good either, there are problems in distribution. We must arrange
things so that yarn-spinners can buy raw cotton whenever they want it, and
cloth-wavers can buy yarn whenever they want it. As regards finished products,
the markets for cotton cloth and woollen products are not stable. We must
arrange things so that producers can sell their products at any time; of
suitable market-prices. These problems must be solved by the combined strength
of the financial organs, commercial organs and the people's cooperatives.
<P>
(4) As for problems in the supply of clothing and bedding, we must act according
to the methods implemented by the Finance Department in 1942 so as to economize
on costs and get clothing at the right time.
<P>
Our papermaking industry can already produce over 5,000 rolls of
<B><I>malan</I></B> paper per year. In 1943 we can increase this to 7,000
rolls, which is entirely sufficient for our printing needs. However, we must
(i) unify the production and supply of paper. <B><I>malan</I></B> paper is
not suitable for general use apart from printing. It cannot be sold if the
printing departments do not want it. At present we have the following situation:
if the printing factories do not use enough, the paper factories cannot sell
and have to stockpile, capital turnover is sluggish and this influences
production. In order to solve this contradiction between supply and demand
in 1943, we should unify purchase and supply, and make precise economic
relationships between particular official organizations and paper factories.
(2) We must improve the quality of the paper. With existing equipment and
technical conditions the quality of the paper can be improved at a greater
cost in work and raw materials. From the point of view of function and
significance, a slightly greater cost is worth-while. On the other hand we
must study improvements in papermaking implements so as to raise production
efficiency.
<P>
Our printing industry is a modernized cultural tool, and a large quantity
of books and papers depend on it. In 1942 printing shops of the Central
Committee, Eighth Route Army and Northwest Bureau printed 51,600,000 characters.
In 1943 this can be increased to 53,600,000. However, we must increase equipment
and ensure the supply of paper.
<P>
Our chemical industry includes medicine, soap, leather, pottery, glass, alcohol,
matches, petrol and so forth. The Eighth Route Army and Guanghua medicine
factories can produce some of the Western and Chinese medicines needed for
military and public use, but we are still not entirely self-sufficient. In
1943 we should study the medicinal materials produced in the Border Region,
and set up the means for buying raw materials so as to increase the production
of necessary medicines. The Xinhua and Daguang factories make soap. Their
production increases daily and their quality is good. As well as meeting
our own needs, they can sell outside. In 1943 the Xinhua factory can produce
420,000 pieces of soap valued at 7 million <B><I>yuan</I></B>. And it has
prospects of development. The scale of leather-tanning is small and the cost
of materials high. It cannot develop much. If we could use plant materials
produced in the Border Region to manufacture leather for military use then
there would be some prospect of development. There are three small pottery
kilns making pottery for daily and industrial uses. Glass has already been
successfully trial-produced and we have decided to set up a factory. We can
also make our own alcohol for industrial and medical use. We have still not
been able to solve the problem of supply of phosphorous for making matches.
We are now investigating the possibility of getting it from animal bones.
Apart from these, there is petrol from Yanchang which supplies a little each
year for military use. The white wax it contains can be supplied for daily
use. In sum, the chemical industry must choose to expand and introduce the
supply of things which are urgently needed or are profitable and possible.
It should not bother with the rest.
<P>
Our tool-manufacturing industry supplies spinning-machinery, weaving-machinery,
cotton-bowing and crushing machinery. paper-making equipment, horse-carts,
carpenters' tools, agricultural implements and so forth. They are mainly
handicraft tools but are extremely important. We must do research into
improvements, and provide for expansion.
<P>
Our coal industry is concentrated in Yan'an and Guanzhong. Its output is
for daily use. Although it is small-scale, It is very important.
<P>
The Border Region lacks iron, which impedes the manufacture and improvement
of industrial and agricultural tools. At present we are holding trials in
Guanzhong and there are hopes of success. If we can make iron, we can solve
a major problem of the Border Region.
<P>
The above discussion has roughly covered the whole of publicly-run,
self-sufficient industry. Textiles, papermaking, bedding and clothing, printing,
chemical, tool-making and coal, all have reasonable prospects for development.
Their first target is to meet the needs of the army and government, and their
second is to supply some of the people's needs. We should make the following
improvements in 1943 in order to meet these targets.
<P>
(1) Increase capital (the amount to be decided). Each official organization
concerned should draw up concrete plans for consideration by the Finance
and Economy Office [of the Border Region Government - <B><I>caijing
Banshichu</I></B> ]<I> </I>with the aim of investing in each. Of the various
industries and in certain investigation and research undertakings, in order
to promote the development of self-sufficient industry in a planned way.
<P>
(2) Establish a unified leadership for the whole of self-supporting industry,
overcome the serious anarchy which exists now; The principle of 'centralized
leadership and dispersed operation' put forward earlier is correct but it
has not been thoroughly implemented. As a result, there is lack of planning,
excessive dispersal in production, lack of work inspection and waste of manpower
and materials among the industries run by the Reconstruction Department,
the Finance Department, the troops and the official organizations. In 1943
we should set up unified leadership under the Finance and Economy Office
and first make all self-supporting industry have a unified plan, no matter
which branch it controls. In the unified plan we should calculate as a whole
the supplies of raw materials, grain and straw, the totals for production
and the coordination of sales. In supplying raw materials we must deal with
the problem of many factories facing regular raw-material crises because
the region is spread out and these materials are not concentrated, or because
supply comes from outside. In supplying grain and hay, we should provide
the factories with the grain and hay they need as calculated by the Finance
Department so as to save distracting the responsible people at each factory
from their concentration on looking after production. In respect of the problems
of production and sales, the Finance Department and the official organization
concerned should, under the unified plan of the Finance and Economy Office,
give each factory responsibility to produce a definite amount so that whatever
is needed is produced in the quantity required and the finished products
are accepted by a definite organ at the right time solving the contradiction
between production and supply. In the unified plan we must realize mutual
aid between enterprises and get rid of departmentalism, which gives rise
to independence from each other or even hindrance of each other. We must
also realize unified inspection, giving encouragement and criticism so that
the poor catch up with the good. In sum, the problem of unified leadership
is the central problem in advancing self-supporting industry during 1943.
We must make thorough efforts to solve it.
<P>
(3) Establish the system of economic accounting <B><I>[jingji
hesuanzhi]</I></B> overcome the muddled situation within the enterprises.
To achieve this we must do the following. First, each factory unit should
have independent capital (liquid and fixed ) so that it can handle the capital
itself and its production is not frequently hindered through capital problems.
Second, income and expenditure in each factory unit should be handled according
to fixed regulations and procedures, putting an end to the confused situation
where income and expenditure are not clear and procedures are not settled.
Third, according to the actual situation in the factories some should adopt
the cost-accounting system <B><I>[chengben kuaijizhi]</I></B> and some need
not for the time being. However, all factories must calculate costs. Fourth,
each factory should have regulations for inspecting the rate of progress
in completing the annual and monthly plans. They should not let things slide
by doing without inspections for long periods. Fifth, each factory should
have regulations for economizing on raw materials and looking after tools,
and for fostering the practice of doing these things. All these points are
the chief elements of the system of economic accounting. Once we have a strict
accounting system, we can examine fully whether an enterprise is profitably
operated or not.
<P>
(4) Improve factory organization and administration, overcome the tendency
to build organizations like those of government organs
<B><I>[jiguanhua]</I></B> and relaxation of discipline. The first thing we
must reform is the irrational phenomenon of excessive staffing in factories.
At present many of our factories are extremely irrationally organized. There
are too many personnel, the organization is too large, the ratio between
administrative personnel and those directly involved in production is not
right, and systems for administering large factories are being used in our
small factories. These phenomena must be quickly corrected so that all factories
carry out 'enterprization' <B><I>[qiyehua].</I></B> All factories should
shrink or grow according to their economic prosperity. All salaries should
be paid from the factories' own profit and not from tax grant, government
clothing and government grants. Second, we should implement the ten-hour
work system and the progressive piecework wages system <B><I>[jijian leijin
gongzizhi]</I></B> so as to raise work enthusiasm and increase production.
The eight-hour system is something to be implemented in future with the
development of large-scale industry. At present we should universally implement
the ten-hour system and make employees understand that this is a requirement
of the War of Resistance. An egalitarian system of wages destroys the distinction
between skilled labour and unskilled labour and the distinction between
industriousness and laziness, thus lowering work enthusiasm. We can only
stimulate labour enthusiasm and increase the quantity and quality of production
by replacing it with a progressive piecework wages system. For the moment
industrial production in the army cannot adopt the piecework wages system
and should have the piecework incentive system <B><I>[jijian jiangli
zhidu]</I></B>. Next, we should improve the work of the workers' congress
<B><I>[zhigonghui</I></B>] and launch a Zhao Zhankui (A model worker) movement
in every factory. Work done by the workers' congress which is not suitable
for raising labour discipline and activism must be changed. Within a factory,
the work of the administration, Party branch and workers' congress must be
united towards common ends. These common ends are to save as much as possible
on costs (raw materials, tools and other expenses), to make as many and as
good products as possible, and to sell them as quickly and as profitably
as possible. These tasks of lower costs, better products and faster sales
are the tasks shared by the administration, Party branch and workers' congress,
all three of which should unite as one. Working methods which divide their
work into three separate areas are entirely wrong. The three sides must organize
a unified committee, in the first place to put administrative personnel,
administrative work, and production plans on the right track. The task of
the Party and the workers' congress is to ensure completion of the production
plans. Finally the factory should reward the workers and employees with the
greatest achievements, and criticize or punish workers and employees who
commit errors. Without a suitable system of rewards and punishments, we Cannot
ensure the improvement of labour discipline and labour enthusiasm.
<P>
(5) Strengthen and enlarge textile mills, increase output of bolts of cotton
cloth, Struggle to achieve complete self-sufficiency in cotton cloth used
by the government in 1944. Improve woollen goods and, after supplying the
army's needs, increase the amount exported. In the bedding and clothing industry
fix standards for the cotton cloth used and the methods of making up. Ensure
that cotton garments and bedding can be used for two years.
<P>
(6) Put papermaking factories in order, improve the quality of paper. Ensure
it is fully satisfactory for printing and office use. Make us entirely
self-sufficient in paper for printing and office use in 1944.
<P>
(7) Increase production of coal and oil, ensure self-sufficiency and also
some exports. Set up ways of making or buying phosphorous so that match-factories
can be established. As for other industries, continue with or enlarge those
which are urgently needed or profitable. All those which do not match the
principle of ensuring supplies or are unprofitable should be merged or closed
down.
