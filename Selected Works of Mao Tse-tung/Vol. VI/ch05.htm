<h3>
5. Organization For Guerilla Warfare
</h3>

<hr class="end" />


<p>
Four points must be considered under this subject. These are:
</p>
<p class="indentb">
    How are guerrilla bands formed?
<br />
    How are guerrilla bands organized?
<br />
    What are the methods of arming guerrilla bands?
<br />
    What elements constitute a guerrilla band?
</p>
<p>
These are all questions pertaining to the organization armed guerrilla units;
they are questions which those who had no experience in guerilla hostilities
do not understand and on which they can arrive at no sound decisions; indeed,
they would not know in what manner to begin.
</p>
<h4>
  How Guerrilla Units Are Originally Formed
</h4>

<p>
The unit may originate in any one of the following ways:
</p> <p class="indentb">
  a) From the masses of the people.
<br />
  b) From regular army units temporarily detailed for the purpose.
<br />
  c) From regular army units permanently detailed.
<br />
  d) From the combination of a regular army unit and a unit recruited from
  the people.
<br />
  e) From the local militia.
<br />
  f) From deserters from the ranks of the enemy.
<br />
  g) From former bandits and bandit groups.
</p>
<p>
In the present hostilities, no doubt, all these sources will be employed.
</p>
<p>
In the first case above, the guerrilla unit is formed from the people. This
is the fundamental type. Upon the arrival of the enemy army to oppress and
slaughter the people, their leaders call upon them to resist. They assemble
the most valorous elements, arm them with old rifles or whatever firearms
they can, and thus a guerrilla unit begins. Orders have already been issued
throughout the nation that call upon the people to form guerrilla units both
for local defense and for other combat. If the local governments approve
and aid such movements, they cannot fail to prosper. In some places, where
the local government is not determined or where its officers have all fled,
the leaders among the masses (relying on the sympathy of the people and their
sincere desire to resist Japan and succor the country ) call upon the people
to resist, and they respond. Thus, many guerrilla units are organized. In
circumstances of this kind, the duties of leadership usually fall upon the
shoulders of young students, teachers, professors, other educators, local
soldiery, professional men, artisans, and those without a fixed profession,
who are willing to exert themselves to the last drop of their blood. Recently,
in Shansi, Hopeh, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shantung, Chekiang, Anhwei, Kiangsu, and
other provinces, extensive guerrilla hostilities have broken out. All these
are organized and led by patriots. The amount of such activity is the best
proof of the foregoing statement. The more such bands there are, the better
will the situation be. Each district, each county, should be able to organize
a great number of guerrilla squads, which, when assembled, form a guerrilla
company.
</p>
<p>
There are those who say: 'I am a farmer', or, 'I am a student'; 'I can discuss
literature but not military arts.' This is incorrect. There is no profound
difference between the farmer and the soldier. You must have courage. You
simply leave your farms and become soldiers. That you are farmers is of no
difference, and if you have education, that is so much the better. When you
take your arms in hand, you become soldiers; when you are organized, you
become military units.
</p>
<p>
Guerrilla hostilities are the university of war, and after you have fought
several times valiantly and aggressively, you may become a leader of troops
and there will be many well-known regular soldiers who will not be your peers.
Without question, the fountainhead of guerrilla warfare is in the masses
of the people, who organize guerrilla units directly from themselves.
</p>
<p>
The second type of guerrilla unit is that which is organized from small units
of the regular forces temporarily detached for the purpose. For example,
since hostilities commenced, many groups have been temporarily detached from
armies, divisions, and brigades and have been assigned guerrilla duties.
A regiment of the regular army may, if circumstances warrant, be dispersed
into groups for the purpose of carrying on guerrilla operations. As an example
of this, there is the Eighth Route Army, in North China. Excluding the periods
when it carries on mobile operations as an army, it is divided into its elements
and these carry on guerrilla hostilities. This type of guerrilla unit is
essential for two reasons. First, in mobile-warfare situations, the co-ordination
of guerrilla activities with regular operations is necessary. Second, until
guerrilla hostilities can be developed on a grand scale, there is no one
to carry out guerrilla missions but regulars. Historical experience shows
us that regular army units are not able to undergo the hardships of guerrilla
campaigning over long periods. The leaders of regular units engaged in guerrilla
operations must be extremely adaptable. They must study the methods of guerrilla
war. They must understand that initiative, discipline, and the employment
of stratagems are all of the utmost importance. As the guerrilla status of
regular units is but temporary, their leaders must lend all possible support
to the organization of guerrilla units from among the people. These units
must be so disciplined that they hold together after the departure of the
regulars.
</p>
<p>
The third type of unit consists of a detachment of regulars who are permanently
assigned guerrilla duties. This type of small detachment does not have to
be prepared to rejoin the regular forces. Its post is somewhere in the rear
of the enemy, and there it becomes the backbone of guerrilla organization.
As an example of this type of organization we may take the Wu Tat Shan district
in the heart of the Hopeh-Chahar-Shansi area. Along the borders of these
provinces, units from the Eighth Route Army have established a framework
or guerrilla operations. Around these small cores, many detachments have
been organized and the area of guerrilla activity greatly expanded. In areas
in which there is a possibility of cutting the enemy's lines of supply, this
system should be used. Severing enemy, supply routes destroys his lifeline;
this is one feature that cannot be neglected. If, at the time the regular
forces withdraw from a certain area, some units left behind, these should
conduct guerrilla operations in the enemy's rear. As an example of this,
we have the guerrilla bands now continuing their independent operations in
the Shanghai- Woosung area in spite of the withdrawal of regular forces.
</p>
<p>
The fourth type of organization is the result of a merger between small regular
detachments and local guerrilla units. The regular forces may dispatch a
squad, a platoon, or a company, which is placed at the disposal of the local
guerrilla commander. If a small group experienced in military and political
affairs is sent, it becomes the core of the local guerrilla unit. These several
methods are all excellent, and if properly applied, the intensity of guerilla
warfare can be extended. In the Wu Tat Shan area, each of these methods has
been used.
</p>
<p>
The fifth type mentioned above is from the local militia, from police and
home guards. In every North China province, there are now many of these groups,
and they should be formed in every locality. The government has issued mandate
to the effect that the people are not to depart from war areas. The officer
in command of the county, the commander of the peace-preservation unit, the
chief of police are all required to obey this mandate. They cannot retreat
with their forces but must remain at their stations and resist.
</p>
<p>
The sixth type of unit is that organized from troops that come over from
the enemy&#151;the Chinese 'traitor' troops employed by the Japanese. It is
always possible to produce disaffection in their ranks, and we must increase
our propaganda efforts and foment mutinies among such troops. Immediately
after mutinying, they must be received into our ranks and organized. The
concord of the leaders and the assent of the men must be gained, and the
units rebuilt politically and reorganized militarily. Once this has been
accomplished, they become successful guerrilla units. In regard to this type
of unit, it may be said that political work among them is of utmost importance.
</p>
<p>
The seventh type of guerrilla organization is that formed from bands of bandits
and brigands. This, although difficult, must be carried out with utmost vigour
lest the enemy use such bands to his own advantages. Many bandit groups pose
as anti-Japanese guerrillas, and it is only necessary to correct their political
beliefs to convert them.
</p>
<p>
In spite of inescapable differences in the fundamental types of guerrilla
bands, it is possible to unite them to form a vast sea of guerrillas. The
ancients said, 'Tai Shan is a great mountain because it does not scorn the
merest handful of dirt; the rivers and seas are deep because they absorb
the waters of small streams.' Attention paid to the enlistment and organization
of guerrillas of every type and from every source will increase the
potentialities of guerrilla action in the anti-Japanese war. This is something
that patriots will not neglect.
</p>
<h4>
  THE METHOD OF ORGANIZING GUERRILLA REGIMES
</h4>
<p>
Many of those who decide to participate in guerrilla activities do not know
the methods of organization. For such people, as well as for students who
have no knowledge of military affairs, the matter of organization is a problem
that requires solution. Even among those who have military knowledge, there
are some who know nothing of guerrilla regimes use they are lacking in that
particular type of experience. The subject of the organization of such regimes
is not confined to the organization of specific units but includes all guerrilla
activities within the area where the regime functions.
</p>
<p>
As an example of such organization, we may take a geographical area in the
enemy's rear. This area may comprise many counties. It must be sub-divided
and individual companies or battalions formed to accord with the sub-divisions.
To this 'military area', a military commander and political commissioners
are appointed. Under these, the necessary officers both military and political,
are appointed. In the military headquarters, there will be the staff, the
aides, the supply officers, and the medical personnel. These are controlled
by the chief of staff, who acts in accordance with orders from the commander.
In the political headquarters, there are bureaus of propaganda organization,
people's mass movements, and miscellaneous affairs. Control of these is vested
in the political chairman.
</p>
<p>
The military areas are sub-divided into smaller districts in accordance with
local geography, the enemy situation locally, and the state of guerrilla
development. Each of these smaller divisions within the area is a district,
each of which may consist of from two to six counties. To each district,
a military commander and several political commissioners are appointed. Under
their direction, military and political headquarters are organized. Tasks
are assigned in accordance with the number of guerrilla troops available.
Although the names of the officers in the 'district' correspond to those
in the larger 'area', the number of the functionaries assigned in the former
case should be reduced to the least possible. In order to unify control,
to handle guerrilla troops that come from different sources, and to harmonize
military operations and local political affairs, a committee of from seven
to nine members should be organized in each area and district. This committee,
the members of which are selected by the troops and the local political officers,
should function as a forum for the discussion of both military and political
matters.
</p>
<p>
All the people in an area should arm themselves and be organized into two
groups. One of these groups is a combat group, the other a self-defence unit
with but limited military quality. Regular combatant guerrillas are organized
into one of three general types of units. The first of these is the small
unit, the platoon or company. In each county, three to six units may be
organized. The second type is the battalion of from two to four companies.
One such unit should be organized in each county. While the unit fundamentally
belongs to the county in it was organized, it may operate in other counties.
While in areas other than its own, it must operate in conjunction with local
units in order to take advantage of their manpower, their knowledge of local
terrain and local customs, and their information of the enemy.
</p>
<p>
The third type is the guerrilla regiment, which consists of from two to four
of the above-mentioned battalion units. If sufficient manpower is available,
a guerrilla a brigade of from two to four regiments may be formed.
</p>
<p>
Each of the units has its own peculiarities of organization. A squad, the
smallest unit, has a strength of from nine to eleven men, including the leader
and the assistant leader. Its arms may be from two to five Western-style
rifles, with the remaining men armed with rifles of local manufacture,
fowling-pieces, etc., spears, or big swords. Two to four such squads form
a platoon. This too has a leader and an assistant leader, and when acting
independently, it is assigned a political officer to carry on political
propaganda work. The platoon may have about ten rifles, with the remainder
of its four of such units from a company, which, like the platoon, has a
leader, an assistant leader, and a political officer. All these units are
under the direct supervision of the military commanders of the areas in which
they operate.
</p>
<p>
The battalion unit must be more thoroughly organized and better equipped
than the smaller units. Its discipline and its personnel should be superior.
If a battalion is formed from company units, it should not deprive subordinate
units entirely of their manpower and their arms. If in a small area, there
is a peace-preservation corps, a branch of the militia, or police, regular
guerrilla units should not be dispersed over it.
</p>
<p>
The guerrilla unit next in size to the battalion is the regiment. This must
be under more severe discipline than the battalion. In an independent guerrilla
regiment, there may be ten men per squad, three squad per platoon, three
platoons per company, three companies per battalion, and three battalions
to the regiment. Two of such regiments form a brigade. Each of these units
has a commander, a vice-commander, and a political officer.
</p>
<p>
In North China, guerrilla cavalry units should be established. These may
be regiments of from two to four companies, or battalions.
</p>
<p>
All these units from the lowest to the highest are combatant guerrilla units
and receive their supplies from the central government. Details of their
organization are shown in the tables.
</p>
<p>
All the people of both sexes from the ages of sixteen to forty-five must
be organized into anti-Japanese self-defence units, the basis of which is
voluntary service. As a first step, they must procure arms, then they must
be given both military and political training. Their responsibilities are
: local sentry duties, securing information of the enemy, arresting traitors,
and preventing the dissemination of enemy propaganda. When the enemy launches
a guerrilla-suppression drive, these units, armed with what weapons there
are, are assigned to certain areas to deceive, hinder, and harass him. Thus,
the defence units assist the combatant guerrillas. They have other functions.
They furnish stretcher-bearers to transport the wounded , carriers to take
food to the troops, and comfort missions to provide the troops with tea and
rice. If a locality can organize such a self-defence unit as we have described,
the traitors cannot hide nor can bandits and robbers disturb the peace of
the people. Thus the people will continue to assist the guerrilla and supply
manpower to our regular armies. 'The organization of self-defence units is
a transitional step in the development of universal conscription. Such units
are reservoirs of manpower for the orthodox forces.'
</p>
<p>
There have been such organizations for some time in Shansi, Shensi, Honan,
and Suiyuan. The youth organizations in different provinces were formed for
the purpose of educating the young. They have been of some help. However,
they were not voluntary, and confidence of the people was thus not gained.
These organizations were not widespread, and their effect was almost negligible.
This system was, therefore, supplanted by the new-type organizations,. Which
are organized on the principles of voluntary co-operation and non-separation
of the members from their native localities. When the members of these
organizations are in their native towns, they support themselves . Only in
case of military necessity are they ordered to remote places, and when this
is done, the government must support them. Each member of these groups must
have a weapon even if the weapon is only a knife, a pistol, a lance, or a
spear.
</p>
<p>
In all places where the enemy operates, these self-defence units should organize
within themselves a small guerrilla group of perhaps from three to ten men
armed with pistols or revolvers. This group is not required to leave its
native locality.
</p>
<p>
The organization of these self-defence units is mentioned in this book because
such units are useful for the purposes of inculcating the people with military
and political knowledge, keeping order in the rear, and replenishing the
ranks of the regulars. These groups should be organized not only in the active
war zones but in every province in China. 'The people must be inspired to
co-operate voluntarily. We must not force them, for if we do, it will be
ineffectual.' This is extremely important.
</p>
<p>
In order to control anti-Japanese military organization as a whole, it is
necessary to establish a system of military areas and districts along the
lines we have indicated.
</p>
<h4>
  EQUIPMENT OF GUERRILLAS
</h4>
<p>
In regard to the problem of guerrilla equipment, it must be understood that
guerrillas are lightly-armed attack groups, which require simple equipment.
The standard of equipment is based upon the nature of duties assigned; the
equipment of low-class guerrilla units is not as good as that of higher-class
units. For example, those who are assigned the task of destroying rail
communications are better equipped than those who do not have that task.
The equipment of guerrillas cannot be based on what the guerrillas want,
to even what they need, but must be based on what is available for their
use. Equipment cannot be furnished immediately but must be acquired gradually.
These are points to be kept in mind .
</p>
<p>
The question of equipment includes the collection, supply, distribution,
and replacement of weapons, ammunition, blankets, communication materials,
transport, and facilities for propaganda work. The supply of weapons and
ammunition is most difficult, particularly at the time the unit is established,
but this problem can always be solved eventually. Guerrilla bands that originate
in the people are furnished with revolvers, pistols, rifles, spears, big
swords, and land mines and mortars of local manufacture. Other elementary
weapons are added and as many new-type rifles as are available are distributed.
After a period of resistance, it is possible to increase the supply of equipment
by capturing it from the enemy. In this respect, the transport companies
are the easiest to equip, for in any successful attack, we will capture the
enemy's transport.
</p>
<p>
An armory should be established in each guerrilla district for the manufacture
and repair of rifles and for the production of cartridge, hand grenades and
bayonets. Guerrillas must not depend to much on an armory. The enemy is the
principal source of their supply.
</p>
<p>
For destruction of railway tracks, bridges, and stations in enemy-controlled
territory, it is necessary to gather together demolition materials. Troops
must be trained in the preparation and use of demolitions, and a demolition
unit must be organized in each regiment.
</p>
<p>
As for minimum clothing requirements, these are that each man shall have
at least two summer-weight uniforms, one suit of winter clothing, two hats,
a pair of wrap puttees, and blanket. Each man must have a pack or a bag for
food. In the north, each man must have an overcoat. In acquiring this clothing,
we cannot depend on captures made by the enemy, for it is forbidden for captors
to take clothing from their prisoners. In order to maintain high morale in
guerrilla forces, all the clothing and equipment mentioned should be furnished
by the representatives of the government in each guerrilla district. These
men may confiscate clothing from traitors or ask contributions from those
best able to afford them. In subordinate groups, uniforms are unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
Telephone and radio equipment is not necessary in lower groups, but all units
from regiment up are equipped with both. This material can be obtained by
contributions from the regular forces and by capture from the enemy.
</p>
<p>
In the guerrilla army in general, and at bases in particular, there must be a high standard of medical equipment. Besides
the services of the doctors, medicines must be procured. Although
guerrillas can depend on the enemy for some portion of their medical supplies,
they must, in general, depend upon contributions. If Western medicines
are not available, local medicines must be made to suffice.
</p>
<p>
The problem of transport is more vital in North-China than in the south,
for in the south all that are necessary are mules and horses. Small guerrilla
units need no animals, but regiments and brigades will find them necessary.
Commanders and staffs of units from companies up should be furnished a riding
animal each. At times, two officers will have to share a horse. Officers
whose duties are of minor nature do not have to be mounted.
</p>
<p>
Propaganda materials are very important. Every large guerrilla unit should
have a printing press and a mimeograph stone. They must also have paper on
which to print propaganda leaflets and notices. They must be supplied with
large brushes. In guerrilla areas, there should be a printing press or a
lead-type press.
</p>
<p>
For the purpose of printing training instructions, this material is of the
greatest importance.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the equipment listed above, it is necessary to have field-glasses,
compasses, and military maps. An accomplished guerrilla group will acquire
these things.
</p>
<p>
Because of the proved importance of guerrilla hostilities in the anti-Japanese
war, the headquarters of the Nationalist Government and the commanding officers
of the various war zones should do their best to supply the guerrillas with
what they actually need and are unable to get for themselves. However, it
must be repeated that guerrilla equipment will in the main depend on the
efforts of the guerrillas themselves. If they depend on higher officers too
much, the psychological effect will be to weaken the guerrilla spirit of
resistance.
</p>
<h4>
  ELEMENTS OF THE GUERRILLA ARMY
</h4>
<p>
The term 'element' as used in the title to this section refers to the personnel,
both officers and men, of the guerrilla army. Since each guerrilla group
fights in a protracted war, its officers must be brave and positive men whose
entire loyalty is dedicated to the cause of emancipation of the people. An
officer should have the following qualities: great powers of endurance so
that in spite of any hardship he sets an example to his men and be a model
for them; he must be able to mix easily with the people; his spirit and that
of the men must be one in strengthening the policy of resistance to the Japanese.
If he wishes to gain victories, he must study tactics. A guerrilla group
with officers of this calibre would be unbeatable. I do not mean that every
guerrilla group can have, at its inception, officers of such qualities. The
officers must be men naturally endowed with good qualities which can be developed
during the course of campaigning. The most important natural quality is that
of complete loyalty to the idea of people's emancipation. If this is present,
the others will develop; if it is not present, nothing can be done. When
officers are first selected from a group, it is this quality that should
receive particular attention. The officers in a group should be inhabitants
of the locality in which the group is organized, as this will facilitate
relations between them and the local civilians. In addition, officers so
chosen would be familiar with conditions. If in any locality there are not
enough men of sufficiently high qualifications to become officers, an effort
must be made to train and educate the people so these qualities may be developed
and the potential officer material increased. There can be no disagreements
between officers native to one place and those from other localities.
</p>
<p>
A guerrilla group ought to operate on the principle that only volunteers
are acceptable for service. It is a mistake to impress people into service.
As long as a person is willing to fight, his social condition or position
is no consideration, but only men who are courageous and determined can bear
the hardships of guerrilla campaigning in a protracted war.
</p>
<p>
A soldier who habitually breaks regulations must be dismissed from the army.
Vagabonds and vicious people must not be accepted for service. The opium
habit must be forbidden, and a soldier who cannot break himself of the habit should be dismissed. Victory in guerrilla war is conditioned upon
keeping the membership pure and clean.
</p>
<p>
It is a fact that during the war the enemy may take advantage of certain
people who are lacking in conscience and patriotism and induce them to join
the guerrillas for the purpose of betraying them. Officers must, therefore,
continually educate the soldiers and inculcate patriotism in them. This will
prevent the success of traitors. The traitors who are in the ranks must be
discovered and expelled, and punishment and expulsion meted out to those
who have been influenced by them. In all such cases, the officers should
summon the soldiers and relate the facts to them, thus arousing their hatred
and detestation for traitors. This procedure will serve as well as a warning
to the other soldiers. If an officer is discovered to be a traitor, some
prudence must be used in the punishment adjudged. However, the work of
eliminating traitors in the army begins with their elimination from among
the people.
</p>
<p>
Chinese soldiers who have served under puppet governments and bandits who
have been converted should be welcomed as individuals or as groups. They
should be well-treated and repatriated. But care should be used during their
reorientation to distinguish those whose idea is to fight the Japanese from
those who may be present for other reasons.
