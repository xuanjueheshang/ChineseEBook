<h3>
2. The Relation Of Guerrilla Hostilitiesto Regular Operations
</h3>

<hr class="end" />


<p>
The general features of orthodox hostilities, that is, the war of position
and the war of movement, differ fundamentally from guerrilla warfare. There
are other readily apparent differences such as those in organization, armament,
equipment supply, tactics, command; in conception of the terms 'front' and
'rear'; in the matter of military responsibilities.
</p>
<p>
When considered from the point of view of total numbers, guerrilla units
are many, as individual combat units, they may vary in size from the smallest,
of several score or several hundred men, to the battalion or the regiment,
of several thousand. This is not the case in regularly organized units. A
primary feature of guerrilla operations is their dependence upon the people
themselves to organize battalions and other units. As a result of this,
organization depends largely upon local circumstances. In the case of guerrilla
groups, the standard of equipment is of a low order and they must depend
for their sustenance primarily upon what the locality affords.
</p>
<p>
The strategy of guerrilla warfare is manifestly unlike that employed in orthodox
operations, as the basic tactic of the former is constant activity and movement.
There is in guerrilla warfare no such thing as a decisive battle; there is
nothing comparable to the fixed, passive defence that characterizes orthodox
war. In guerrilla warfare, the transformation of a moving situation into
a positional defensive situation never arises. The general features of
reconnaissance, partial deployment, general deployment, and development of
the attack that are usual in mobile warfare are not common in guerrilla war.
</p>
<p>
There are differences also in the matter of leadership and command. In guerrilla
warfare, small units acting independently play the principal role and there
must be no excessive interference with their activities. In orthodox warfare
particularly in a moving situation, a certain degree of initiative is accorded
subordinates, but in principle, command is centralized. This is done because
all units and all supporting arms in all districts must co-ordinate to the
highest degree. In the case of guerrilla warfare, this is not only undesirable
but impossible. Only adjacent guerrilla units can coordinate their activities
to any degree. Strategically, their activities can be roughly correlated
with those of the regular forces, and tactically, they must co-operate with
adjacent units of the regular army. But there are no strictures on the extent
of guerrilla activity nor is it primarily characterized by the quality of
co-operation of many units.
</p>
<p>
When we discuss the terms 'front' and 'rear' it must be remembered, that
while guerrillas do have bases, their primary field of<B> </B>activity is
in the enemy's rear areas. They themselves have no rear. Because an orthodox
army has rear installations (except in some special cases as during the
10,000-mile Long march of the Red Army or as in the case of certain units
operating in Shansi Province), it cannot operate as guerrillas can.
</p>
<p>
As to the matter of military responsibilities, those of the guerrillas are
to exterminate small forces of the enemy; to harass and weaken large forces;
to attack enemy lines of communications; to establish bases capable of supporting
independent operations in the enemy's rear, to force the enemy to disperse
his strength; and to co-ordinate all these activities with those of the regular
armies on distant battle fronts.
</p>
<p>
From the foregoing summary of differences that exist between guerrilla warfare
and orthodox warfare, it can be seen that it is improper to compare the two.
Further distinction must be made in order to clarify this matter. While the
Eighth Route Army is a regular army, its North China campaign is essentially
guerrilla in nature, for it operates in enemy's rear. On occasion, however,
Eighth Route Army commanders have concentrated powerful forces to strike
an enemy in motion and the characteristics of orthodox mobile warfare were
evident in the battle at P'ing Hsing Kuan and in other engagements.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, after the fall of Feng Ling Tu, the operations of Central
Shansi, and Suiyuan, troops were more guerrilla than orthodox in nature.
In this connection the precise character of Generalissimo Chiang's instructions
to the effect that independent brigades would carry out guerrilla operations
should be recalled. In spite of such temporary activities these orthodox
units retained their identity and after the fall of Feng Line Tu, they were
not only able to fight along orthodox lines but often found it necessary
to do so. This is an example of the fact that orthodox armies may, due to
changes in the situation, temporarily function as guerrillas.
</p>
<p>
Likewise, guerrilla units formed from the people may gradually develop into
regular units and, when operating as such, employ the tactics of orthodox
mobile war. While these units function as guerrillas, they may be compared
to innumerable gnats, which, by biting a giant both in front and in rear,
ultimately exhaust him. They make themselves as unendurable as a group of
cruel and hateful devils, and as they grow and attain gigantic proportions,
they will find that their victim is not only exhausted but practically perishing.
It is for this very reason that our guerrilla activities are a source of
constant mental worry to Imperial Japan.
</p>
<p>
While it is improper to confuse orthodox with guerrilla operations, it is
equally improper to consider that there is a chasm between the two. While
differences do exist, similarities appear under certain conditions and this
fact must be appreciated if we wish to establish clearly the relationship
between the two. If we consider both types of warfare as a single subject,
or if we confuse guerrilla warfare with the mobile operations of orthodox
war, we fall into this error : We exaggerate the function of guerrillas and
minimize that of the regular armies. If we agree with Chang Tso Hua, who
says - 'Guerrilla warfare is the primary war strategy of a people seeking
to emancipate itself,' or with Kao Kang, who believes that 'Guerrilla strategy
is the only strategy possible for oppressed people', we are exaggerating
the importance of guerrilla hostilities. What these zealous friends I have
just quoted do not realize is this: If we do not fit guerrilla operations
into their proper niche, we cannot promote them realistically. Then, not
only would those who oppose take advantage of our varying opinions to turn
them to the own uses to undermine us, but guerrillas would be led assume
responsibilities they could not successfully discharge and that should properly
be carried out by orthodox force. In the meantime, the important guerrilla
function of co-ordinating activities with the regular forces would be neglected.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, if the theory that guerrilla warfare is our only strategy were
actually applied, the regular forces would be weakened, we would be divided
in purpose, and guerrilla hostilities would decline. If we say, ' Let us
transform the regular forces into guerrillas', and do not place our first
reliance on a victory to be gained by the regular armies over the enemy,
we may certainly expect to see as a result the failure of the anti-Japanese
war of resistance. The concept that guerrilla warfare is an end in itself
and that guerrilla activities can be divorced from those of the regular forces
is incorrect. If we assume that guerrilla warfare does not progress from
beginning to end beyond its elementary forms, we have failed to recognize
the fact that guerrilla hostilities can, under specific conditions, develop
and assume orthodox characteristics. An opinion that admits the existence
of guerrilla war, but isolates it, is one that does not properly estimate
the potentialities of such war.
</p>
<p>
Equally dangerous is the concept that condemns guerrilla war on the ground
that war has no other aspects than the purely orthodox. This opinion is
often expressed by those who have seen the corrupt phenomena of some guerrilla
regimes, observed their lack of discipline, and have seen them used as a
screen behind which certain persons have indulged in bribery and other corrupt
practices. These people will not admit the fundamental necessity for guerrilla
bands that spring from the armed people. They say, 'Only the regular forces
are capable of conducting guerrilla operations.' This theory is a mistaken
one and would lead to the abolition of the people's guerrilla war.
</p>
<p>
A proper conception of the relationship that exists between guerrilla effort
and that of the regular forces is essential. We believe it can be stated
this way: 'Guerrilla operations during the anti-Japanese war may for certain
time and temporarily become its paramount feature, particularly insofar as
the enemy's rear is concerned. However, if we view the war as a whole, there
can be no doubt that our regular forces are of primary importance, because
it is they who are alone capable of producing the decision. Guerrilla warfare
assists them in producing this favourable decision. Orthodox forces may under
certain conditions operate as guerrillas, and the latter may, under certain
conditions, develop to the status of the former. However, both guerrilla
forces and regular forces have their own respective development and their
proper combinations.'
</p>
<p>
To clarify the relationship between the mobile aspect of orthodox war and
guerrilla war, we may say that general agreement exists that the principal
element of our strategy must be mobility. With the war of movement, we may
at times combine the war of position. Both of these are assisted by general
guerrilla hostilities. It is true that on the battlefield mobile war often
becomes positional; it is true that this situation may be reversed; it is
equally true that each form may combine with the other. The possibility of
such combination will become more evident after the prevailing standards
of equipment have been raised. For example, in a general strategical
counter-attack to recapture key cities and lines of communication, it would
be normal to use both mobile and positional methods. However, the point must
again be made that our fundamental strategical form must be the war of movement.
If we deny this, we cannot arrive at the victorious solution of the war.
In sum, while we must promote guerrilla warfare as a necessary strategical
auxiliary to orthodox operations, we must neither assign it the primary position
in our war strategy nor substitute it for mobile and positional warfare as
conducted by orthodox forces.
