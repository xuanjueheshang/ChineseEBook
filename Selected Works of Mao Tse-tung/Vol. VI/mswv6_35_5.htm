  5. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF COOPERATIVES
</h4>
<P>
There were already cooperatives in the Border Region during the civil-war
period. Since the War of Resistance began, the Border Region government has
continued to promote them, and after five-and-a-half years of hard effort
they have gradually expanded.
<P>
In the four years from 1937 to 1941 the number of consumer cooperatives increased
from 130 to 155 and the number of cooperative members from 57,847 to 140,218.
The share capital grew from 55,525 <B><I>yuan</I></B> to 693,071
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The value of sales increased from 261,189
<B><I>yuan</I> </B>to more than 6,008,000 <B><I>yuan</I>. </B>Profits rose
from 4,800 <B><I>yuan</I></B> to over 1,020,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and the
public accumulation fund [<I>gongjijin</I>] increased from 3,500
<B><I>yuan</I></B> to over 173,000 <B>yuan.</B>
<P>
If we compare the October 1942 Statistics for the nineteen county capitals
with those of 1941, the number of cooperative members has increased from
97,297 to 115,899. The share capital has risen abruptly from over 712,900
<B><I>yuan</I></B> to more than 6 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> and the profit
has also grown from 858,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> to more than 3,398,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
The largest amount of share capital owned by individual<B> </B>members of
consumer cooperatives is around 10,000 <B><I>yuan</I> </B>and<B> </B>the
lowest is around 4 or 5 <B><I>yuan</I></B>,
<P>
The distribution of consumer cooperatives at the end of 1941 was as follows:
Yan'an, twenty-eight; Ansai, twelve; Yanchang, eight; Gulin, eight; Dingbian,
eight; Qingyang, Huachi, Quzi and Yanchuan, seven each; Anding, Fuxian and
Wuqi, six each; Ganquan, Jingbian and Heshui, five each; Yan'an city and
Mizhi, four each; and Suide, two. There are still no statistics for the other
counties.
<P>
Turning to producer cooperatives, ten were established In 1939 with the support
of the government and the assistance of the northwest office of the Chinese
Industrial cooperative <I>[Gonghe]. </I>Thereafter some consumer cooperatives
with large amounts of capital also ran producer cooperatives. By October
1942 the number of producer cooperatives had increased from ten to fifty.
The number of employees engaged in production had increased from 199 to 563.
Share capital had grown from 11,130 <B><I>yuan</I> </B>to<B> </B>2,491,600
<B><I>yuan</I> </B>and the total value of monthly production from 60,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> to over 2,300,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
According to this year's statistics the distribution of producer cooperatives
is as follows: Suide, sixteen; Yan'an, seven; Gulin, five; Yanchang, five;
Yanchuan, five; Ganquan, three; Ansai, three; Jingbian, two; Qingyang, one;
Jiaxian, one; Mizhi, one; Anding, one.
<P>
Among the fifty producer cooperatives there are twenty-seven large and small
textile cooperatives, thirteen in Suide, four in Yan'an, two in Gulin, and
one each in Ganquan, Fuxian, Yanchang, Yanchuan, Ansai, Anding, Jiaxian and
Mizhi. Altogether they employ 497 people and their share capital is 1,700,000
<B><I>yuan</I>. </B>Six have twenty-five or more employees, the rest ranging
from three to over ten. If these twenty-seven cooperatives were working at
full capacity, they could produce 30,000 bolts of cloth annually. At the
moment they are only producing around 22,000 bolts, 6,000 woven blankets,
4,152 dozen woolen towels, and 8,400 dozen pairs of woven socks.
<P>
There are five dyeing cooperatives, two in Yanchuan, two in Suide and one
in Yanchang. They employ a total of thirteen people, their share capital
is 128,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and each year they can dye over 7,000 bolts
of cloth. There are five producer cooperatives pressing cottonseed oil. Of
these, two are in Gulin, two in Jingbian, and one in Yanchang. They employ
a total of nineteen people, their share capital 245,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, and each year they can press l0,000 <B><I>jin </I></B>of
cottonseed oil. There are nine flour mills, two each in Ansai, Ganquan, Yanchang,
Yanchuan and one in Gulin. They employ a total of twenty-four people and
their share capital is 262,000 <B><I>yuan</I> </B>There are four blanket-making
cooperatives, two in Yan'an, one in Qingyang, and one in Suide. They employ
a total of forty-two people and their share capital is 152,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. Each year<B> </B>they can produce 7,600 blankets. There
is one pottery cooperative in Yan'an county. It employs seven men, its share
capital is 3,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and each year it produces six kilnloads
of pottery.
<P>
The above statistics show us that both consumer and producer cooperatives
have expanded greatly in terms of membership, share capital, profit and
undertakings. However this development has been uneven. In the past five
years it has gone through three stages. Moreover, qualitative development
only began to advance rapidly during 1942. Before 1939, cooperatives everywhere
were based upon share capital from the government with the addition of some
share capital assessed from the masses. At this time their nature was basically
that of publicly-run enterprises and for the most part they became shops
publicly-run by the county and district governments. Cooperative enterprise
was not facing the masses, but was chiefly facing the government. It was
providing funds for the government and all decisions were taken by the
government. This was the first stage. After 1939, the slogan 'Popularize
the Cooperatives' was put forward. However, most places still used the old
method of assessing share capital from the masses to carry out this so-called
'popularization'. Thus the masses still regarded the cooperatives as a burden,
assessed upon them and not as something of their own. Cooperative personnel
were still the same official personnel. They ordered the masses to do substitute
farm work on their land on their behalf. The masses could not see the great
benefits to the cooperatives for themselves and, on the contrary, considered
that the cooperatives increased the labour burden they had to bear. After
1940, the duty of all the local governments to achieve self-sufficiency in
production was increased. Thereafter the large shareholders in many cooperatives
were not the people but government organs. It was thus even more difficult
for the cooperatives to give due consideration to the interests of the masses.
This was the second stage. It was only in January 1942 that the Reconstruction
Department put forward the strategy of 'overcome the desire to monopolize
everything, implement the policy of the people in control and officials as
helpers', based on the experience of the Southern District Cooperative of
Yan'an county. It was only by implementing this strategy that cooperatives
everywhere did away with the method of levying shares by assessment, and
gradually built up close relations with the masses and experience in being
concerned for the interests of the masses. Thus, in merely ten months the
share capital has risen sharply by more than 5 million <B><I>yuan</I></B>
and undertakings have also expanded. This has played a great role in organizing
the economic strength of the people, reducing middleman exploitation, and
developing the people's economy. This is the third stage. It is only in this
stage that the cooperatives of the Border Region have in general begun to
follow the right path.
<P>
The above outlines the path of development of most cooperatives. However,
there have been exceptions. For example the Southern District Cooperative
of Yan'an county got on to the right path some what earlier. Through several
years of hard experience, this cooperative has become a model cooperative
truly supported by the people. During 1942, cooperatives from the counties
of Suide, Anding, Ansai, Ganquan, Yanchang, Wuqi, etc. have advanced by studying
this model cooperative.
<P>
What, then, are the special features of the Southern District Cooperative?
It has the following good points. (1) It has smashed dogmatism and formalism
in cooperatives, and it does not cling to old ways and regulations. The Southern
District Cooperative began as a consumer cooperative. However, its undertakings
have extended into every aspect of the economic life of all the people of
Southern district. It does not just manage consumer undertakings but handles
supply and distribution, transport, production and credit. It has organized
six producer-cooperatives for textiles, oil-pressing, blanket manufacture
and so forth, and one transport team with more than a hundred animals. It
has become a comprehensive cooperative. It does not concentrate on the percentage
of income that should be devoted to the cooperative's own public accumulation
fund and public welfare fund [gongjijin], but strives to share out its profits
to the members. It does not place a limit on the share dividend and each
member receive a return on his shares regardless of the number held. It does
not limit the right of members to dispose of their shares and each member
has the freedom to withdraw his shareholding at any time. Nor does it limit
the nature of the membership. People from all social strata can join. (Since
Yan'an is an area that has gone through land revolution, allowing people
from all classes to join is no hindrance to the leadership of the cooperative
by the Communist Party.) They can also belong to the organs of the cooperative.
Moreover, it is not necessary to have ready cash to become a shareholder.
Before the cooperative won complete confidence among the masses, it permitted
them to become shareholders. using government bonds <I>[gongzhaiquan] </I>and
savings bonds <I>[chuxupiao]. </I>In this way the share capital was increased.
When the cooperative came to have the confidence of the masses and the masses
wanted to take out Shares but had no money, it allowed them to use any articles
of value such as grain, livestock, eggs and firewood to buy shares. Therefore,
all the people praise it.
<P>
(2) It has smashed formalism in cooperatives, and conscientiously carried
out the policy of facing the masses and working for the benefit of the people.
It has therefore gradually came to be loved and respected by the masses.
For example, every year during spring ploughing, it makes early arrangements
to transport shovels from Hancheng and other places, selling them to the
peasants at a price lower than the market price. It organizes various productive
enterprises, which not only absorb unemployed workers, take on apprentices,
and employ the family dependents of working personnel, but also expand profits,
guarantee the supply of daily necessities to the people of the area and increase
the income of the people. The Southern District Cooperative has organized
more than 800 women to spin yarn. Each month they can spin 1,400
<B><I>jin</I></B>. This has increased the monthly income by 70,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The managerial policy of the consumer cooperative is
to fully ensure the supply of necessary commodities for the people, not only
letting them make fewer trips for their purchases but also charging prices
cheaper than those found in shops of large towns.
<P>
(3) It uses the policy of benefiting both the public and the private sectors
as the bridge between the economic activity of the government and the economic
activity of the people. On the one hand it carries out the financial and
economic policies of the government and on the other it adjusts the burdens
of the people so as to make those burdens more acceptable, raises their income,
and increases their enthusiasm. For example, in 1941 when the government
was mobilizing for the salt-transport levy, the Southern District Cooperative
got the people of the district to hand over a money substitute, and its transport
team transported salt for the government on behalf of the people. Before
the government collects the tax grain, the cooperative mobilizes the people
to pay it to the cooperative itself in accordance with the amount of tax
collected in the previous year. The cooperative guarantees to pay the tax
grain for the current year on behalf of the cooperative members and also
accepts the grain handed over as share capital paid in by people to join
cooperative. Thus on the one hand the cooperative acts on behalf of the
government, ensuring the payment of tax grain using it to make a profit before
it is finally paid over. On the other hand the people not only pay their
tax grain but also get some share capital. As a result some households with
surplus grain have even wished to pay two years' worth of tax grain to the
cooperative. No matter what the increase in tax grain the following year,
the cooperative undertakes to pay the difference. More than forty households
in the district have done this. In this way the burdens of the peasants have
been fixed, their income has increased, and their enthusiasm for production
has also been raised. Another example was when the government of the county
and district wanted the people to pay educational expenses and expenses for
the guard posts of the self-defense army. The cooperative again paid these
for the people from its profits. In this way the government was saved the
trouble of collecting the expenses and the people were not burdened with
the payment. The government policies of encouraging immigration and assisting
refugees can also be carried out by the cooperative (it can give credit to
the refugees and immigrants and so forth). In these ways the interests of
the government, the cooperatives, and the people, the interests of the individual
and the collective are closely united.
<P>
(4) It changes the organizational structure of the cooperative according
to the wishes of the people. It does not hold congresses of all file cooperative
members, but allows the members to elect delegates from each village. It
does not use the method of assessment for raising share capital, but rallies
groups of activist cooperative members to go and encourage the people to
take out shares. It does not limit the share capital of the cooperative members,
and it divides the profit according to shares held. However, in solving the
cooperative's problems it does not consider the number of shares owned. Each
shareholder has equal rights.
<P>
The above are the features of the Southern District Cooperative. As a Consumer
cooperative, its characteristics conform to the basic spirit of consumer
cooperatives and grow from the life, culture, economy, and politics of the
people of the Border Region. As a producer cooperative while not a cooperative
of the producers themselves but enterprise where shareholders hire labour,
its present structure is a means of absorbing unused rural capital to develop
handicrafts and corresponds to existing conditions in the Border Region where
handicrafts are not developed and handicraft workers are few.
<P>
Since 1936 the Southern District Cooperative has gone through six to seven
years of trial and hard struggle. Now it has grown from 160 members to include
more than 90 per cent of the households of the Southern district. The number
of voluntary members is 1,112. The amount of share capital has risen from
159 <B><I>yuan</I></B> to 2 million <B><I>yuan</I></B>. It has grown from
one cooperative to sixteen cooperatives. The net profit has risen from several
tens of <B><I>yuan</I></B> to 1,620,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> for the first
ten months of 1942. It has developed the agricultural, industrial and commercial
enterprises of the people of the district and looked after their economic
welfare, becoming the economic heart of the people of Southern district.
<P>
In the large but under-populated Border Region where the economy is almost
entirely a small-scale peasant economy, it is necessary to rely upon truly
popularized cooperatives to play a pivotal role in implementing the economic
policies of the government and in organizing and encouraging the people to
develop the economy. Thus the road of the Southern District Cooperative is
the road for all the cooperatives of the Border Region. A movement to develop
cooperatives in the style of the Southern District Cooperative is a major
item of work for expanding the economy of the people of the Border Region.
<P>
For this reason, the Party and government should carry out the following
work in cooperatives throughout the Border Region:
<P>
(1) The Reconstruction Department should be responsible for studying the
experience of the Southern District Cooperative and for compiling a small
handbook as educational material for the fourth section <I>[<B>ke</B>] </I>of
all county governments and for the personnel of all cooperatives. Furthermore,
we should use the opportunity presented by holding meetings in Yan'an to
take working cadres from all parts of the Border Region on a tour of the
Southern District Cooperative.
<P>
(2) All the enterprises run by the Commodities Bureau should help successful
consumer and producer cooperatives with supplies and distribution. They should
sell commodities to the consumer cooperatives, and supply raw material to,
and guarantee the purchase of products from, the producer cooperatives. The
government should issue 3 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> to the Commodities Bureau
in 1943 to help in adjusting the cooperatives' supplies and distribution.
<P>
(3) In order to stimulate cooperatives the government must clearly stipulate
and conscientiously carry out a reduction in the cooperatives' tax burden.
<P>
(4) The Border Region Government and the governments of all the counties
should seek out students educated to the upper primary school or higher level
for training as accountants or managers so as to ease the difficulties of
all cooperatives over these.
<P>
(5) The personnel of the cooperatives must implement the policy of
'popularization' and adopt the wages system, doing away with the system of
substitute cultivation for cooperative personnel. They must improve cooperative
organization and simplify administration. They must make them into proper
enterprises and not official organs. They must reduce the working personnel
and reduce expenditure.
<P>
In order to ensure that everyone fully understands the history of the development
of the Southern District Cooperative, we have specially invited its director,
Comrades Liu Jianzhang, to write a report which now follows.
<h4>
  
  THE HISTORY OF THE<BR>
  YAN'AN SOUTHERN DISTRICT COOPERATIVE
</h4>
<h4>
  First Period
</H4>
<P>
On 2 December 1936, we began to propagandize the people to buy shares. At
that time each share was worth 0.30 <B><I>yuan</I></B> in soviet currency.
After twenty days there were 160 members with 533 shares giving a total value
of 159.90 <B><I>Yuan</I></B>.
<P>
Wang Tianjin was elected director, Liu Jianzhang accountant, and Li Shengzhang
buyer.
<P>
Dividends were paid quarterly and the gross profit for the first quarter
was 199.44 <B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
Expenditures were made up of payments to the three personnel 9
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, food 45 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, stationery 3.50
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, woolen socks and gloves to support the front 13
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, help for the dependable of troops of the War of Resistance
15 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, support for the small school 8 <B><I>yuan</I></B>
and public welfare fund 10 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. After expenses, the dividend
per share was 0.18 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, and the total dividend 95.94
<B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
On the occasion of this dividend, we held a cooperative members' congress
attended by all. At this melting we reported on the work done by the cooperative,
shared out the dividend, and gave the members dinner. The meeting produced
great results. The members themselves proposed that since the cooperative
was helping the dependents of soldiers in the War of Resistance, assisting
the small school, and supporting the front with woolen socks and gloves and
so forth on their behalf, everyone should buy more shares. This was the first
period.
<H4>
  
  Second Period
</H4>
<P>
Wang Shengming became treasurer. I planned a large increase in the share
capital. Director Wang was not satisfied. He argued that an increase in share
capital should be carried out when the situation demanded it. I wanted to
take the matter to county government for discussion and later we went to
see Liu Shichang, head of the national economy department [<I>guomin
jingjibi</I>] of the county government. Department head Liu permitted an
increase in share capital. Since Wang Tianjin disagreed with everyone, the
county government moved him to another post.
<P>
In March 1937, Liu Jianzhang was elected director, Wang Shengming accountant,
and Li Shengzhang remained as buyer. Once again there were three people.
On one hand we managed the business and on the other we increased the share
capital. The date for the second payment of dividend was 2 June, 1937. The
total of new shares issued was 2,697, which together with the previous issue
made a total of 3,230 with a value of 969 <B><I>yuan</I></B> at the maintained
rate of 0.30 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per share. The sum of 3,657
<B><I>yuan</I></B> was handled in turnover [<I>guoliushui</I>]<I> </I>during
the three months and the gross profit was 276 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Expenditures
included support for the small school 6 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, support for the
dependents of soldiers in the War of Resistance 12 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, donation
to the appeal for support for the front 20 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, public welfare
fund 10 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, three months' food 53 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, staff
payments 13.50 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, and office expenses 3.50
<B><I>yuan.</I></B> After expenses the dividend per share was 0.05
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, a combined total of 161.50 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. As before,
a congress of cooperative members was held when the dividend was paid. Two-thirds
of the members attended. We reported on the activities of the Cooperative.
At that time we had bought 3 <B><I>tan</I></B> of grain on behalf of the
troops and had also acted as an agent in the purchase of all the charcoal
and firewood used by the reception centre of the Northwest Military Committee
[xibei Jun-wei]. All income from this business was in soviet notes, but the
ordinary people did not agree. They asked the cooperative to request goods
as a pledge when acting as a purchasing agent. On the one hand they should
give some goods and on the other we could accept some soviet notes. At this
time the cadres of the cooperative worked hard and patiently to bring about
agreement between the people and the troops. After this we built up relations
between the army and the people. If the soviet notes held by the people could
not be used to buy things in other places, the cooperative could buy them.
When this was announced, the members gained a greater understanding of the
cooperative and stated that 'the cooperative was able to act on their behalf.'
<H4>
  
  Third Period
</H4>
<P>
Beginning in June 1937 we again planned to increase the number of cadres.
Sun Shenghua was promoted to be a buyer. He worked for one month, every day
acting as buying agent for the troops which he found very troublesome. He
said he wanted to stop working. Despite repeated attempts at persuasion and
education, he was determined not to work for the cooperative and so he left.
Li Shenghai became buyer. We planned to open a fire wood shop at Goumenshang.
The cooperative put up 200 <B><I>yuan </I></B>capital and it became an
independent unit. Li Shengzhang was director of the shop with his wife as
cook and Li Shenghai as assistant. In three months the gross profit was 400
<B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
The current account for the running of the cooperative and the shop was 7,175.60
<B><I>yuan</I></B> and the gross profit 538.70 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Three
<B><I>yuan</I></B> in soviet currency was equivalent to one
<B><I>yuan</I></B> in national currency [baipiao], giving a converted value
of 175 <B><I>yuan</I></B> [<I>yang</I> <I>yuan</I>]. When cooperative members
took out shares, 1 <B><I>yuan</I></B> in Soviet currency was taken as equivalent
to 1 <B><I>yuan</I></B> in national currency. We donated 25
<B><I>yuan</I></B> for the front and 10 <B><I>yuan</I></B> to help the small
school. The director for women's affairs of the district was robbed by local
bandits and new bedding for her cost 4.50 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. The public
welfare fund was 12 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Losses on forged notes came to 8.50
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, payments to staff 45 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, food 90
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, and office expenses 7.50 <B><I>yuan.</I></B> New shares
issued numbered 2,130, making a total of 5,360 with value of 1,596
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. Dividend per share was 0.02 <B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
During this period, the porters in Ansai county, Bao'an county, and our own
district organized a salt-transport cooperative. They pooled their capital
and formed a partnership setting up a salt-transport team with a total of
twelve donkeys, horses and mules. Together with more than one hundred
privately-owned animals, they regularly went to Yanchi to transport salt
which was sold through the cooperative. This also encouraged porters from
other counties to invest 320 <B><I>yuan</I></B> in the shop. During this
period the soviet currency used to buy shares was converted entirely into
national currency.
<P>
We reported to the September cooperative members' meeting. Everyone expressed
the opinion that making the soviet notes worth 1 <B><I>yuan</I></B> in national
currency instead of 0.30 <B><I>yuan</I></B> had increased the trust of the
members. We proposed an increase in the share capital, made a census of the
population and surveyed the conditions of the people's economy. The three
townships of the district had 432 households with a population of 1,733.
There were 222 ox-drawn implements and 323 oxen, 125 donkeys and 270 sheep.
The total value of the people's economy for the whole district was 220,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, including livestock, land, houses and all assets. Excluding
grains, the average annual expenditure per head on clothing, agricultural
implements, salt, matches, etc. was 40 <B><I>yuan,</I></B> making a total
of 69,320 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. We proposed to the meeting that each person
should increase his share capital to 20 <B><I>yuan</I></B> so that we could
provide daily necessities for the people. The members agreed to increase
the share capital and to lengthen the accounting periods from quarterly to
half-yearly.
<H4>
  
  Fourth Period
</H4>
<P>
The fourth period ran from September 1937 to February 1938. The original
value of 0.30 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per share was raised to 0.50
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The total number of shares was 5,360 valued at 2,680
<B><I>yuan.</I></B> The current account was 22,875 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and
the gross profit 1,732.30 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Outgoing were the public
accumulation fund 110 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, the public welfare fund 68
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, woollen socks and gloves to support the front 245
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, support for the dependents of troops in the War of Resistance
18 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, support for the small school 12
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, payments to cooperative personnel and hired labour 310.50
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, food 90 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, entertainment expenses 38.50
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, office expenses 61.50 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, incentives
for personnel 60 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and repairs 285 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. After
expenses the dividend per share was 0.08 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and the total
dividend was 428.80 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Although the cooperative members'
meeting for the previous period had proposed raising the share capital per
person to 20 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, this had only been partly realized because
of difficulties in the people's economy. This time the meeting planned to
establish a credit cooperative with share capital of 1,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. People could come to this cooperative for short-term
loans for marriages and funerals without paying interest. As soon as this
slogan was put forward, the members said they would guarantee the raising
of all share capital. The aim was to provide assistance. We also planned
to open a restaurant in Liulin.
<H4>
  
  Fifth Period
</H4>
<P>
This ran from March to August 1938. First of all we increased the number
of cadres, recruiting Wang Yaoming, Mao Keye, Li Shenghai, Huang Baozhong,
etc. Within three months we raised 1,060 <B><I>yuan</I></B> share capital
for the credit cooperative and in addition increased other share capital
by 110 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Including previous share capital the total was
3,890 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. The current account for the six months was 42,500
<B><I>yuan</I></B> and the gross profit was 3,633 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Expenses
were woolen socks for troops at the front 185 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, relief
appeal donations 22 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, incentives 80 <B><I>yuan</I></B>,
repairs 230 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, meetings and entertainment 85.60
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, office expenses 189 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, payments and
salaries (twenty-four people) 864 <B><I>yuan,</I></B> and food 900
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. After expenses the dividend per share was 0.10
<B><I>yuan</I></B> and the total dividend 778 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. When the
dividend was distributed we held a meeting of cooperative members' group
leaders. We Planned to accumulate 500 <B><I>yuan</I></B> to buy ploughshares.
Each plowshare cost 0.25 <B><I>yuan</I></B> so we could buy 2,000. We also
planned to expand with an oil-pressing shop [<I>youfang</I>], a flour-mill
[<I>fengfang], </I>and a public welfare centre [<I>gongyixin</I>]<I>
</I>so<I> </I>as to establish commercial relations in Yan'an city. On this
occasion none of the group leaders disagreed.
<H4>
  
  Sixth Period
</H4>
<P>
This ran from September 1938 to February 1939. We changed the share value
from 0.50 <B><I>yuan</I></B> to 1 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, and we increased share
capital by 4,510 <B><I>yuan</I></B> making a new total of 8,200
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The current account for the six months was 49,860
<B><I>yuan</I></B> and the gross profit 4,118 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Expenses
included support for dependents of troops in the War of Resistance 34
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, the public accumulation fund 654 <B><I>yuan</I></B>,
the public welfare fund 10 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, incentives 131
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, entertainment 180 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, miscellaneous expenses
116 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, salaries and payments to personnel (thirty people)
867 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and food 1,116 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. During this period
all plans were realized. We bought 2,000 shovels in Hancheng. Each shovel
was worth 0.50 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and the market-price was 0 90
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. We sold them to cooperative members at 0.60
<B><I>yuan</I></B> each, a saving of 0.30 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and a total
saving of 600 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. The oil-pressing shop and flour-mill were
established. In this period we still paid a dividend on a half-yearly basis.
There was a total of 850 cooperative members.
<H4>
  
  Seventh Period
</H4>
<P>
This ran from March to August 1939. We started planning to do business in
partnership with private individuals. In the area there were some people
who wanted to go into business but feared that the government would increase
taxation on them. So they invested their money together with the cooperative
as individual shareholders in a joint venture. First we set up business in
partnership with private individuals in Sanshilipu including a noodle shop
and a restaurant. The cooperative put up 200 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and the
individuals 800 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Through this partnership business we
solved many problems for the people. We made rule allowing the freedom to
invest or withdraw share capital from the cooperative. This lasted until
the end of the year when the government, reaffirming the principles of
cooperatives pointed out that the cooperative had developed the private economy
and this was not allowed. So this business was broken off.
<P>
In the same year we expanded share capital by 860 <B><I>yuan,</I></B> making
a new total of 9,016 <B><I>yuan.</I></B> Cooperative members numbered 960.
<P>
The current account was 57,600 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and the gross profit was
4,778.60 <B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
After deducting the public accumulation fund, welfare fund and other expenses,
the net dividend was 0.10 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per share and the total dividend
901.60 <B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
In the course of paying out this dividend, many difficulties arose. On one
hand the expansion of share capital was slow and the rise in commodity prices
high, making it difficult for the cooperative to operate. On the other hand,
the people reckoned there was no increased profit for the individual, and
were unwilling to invest in more shares. We tried again and again to propagandize
and persuade them but they remained unwilling to invest more. I myself reckoned
that unless we formed partnerships with private individuals, the cooperative
could not develop, and that we should do business in such partnerships without
government approval. I put this forward for discussion at a management meeting
and it was agreed that it should be done.
<h4>
  Eighth period
</H4>
<P>
In September 1939 we again went into partnership with individuals to set
up the Xinghua Branch Cooperative at Sanshilipu, the Limin Cooperative at
Goumenshang, the Minsheng Herbalist at Liulin, and the Lihe Cooperative at
Nanzhuanghe. Using the cover of being joint public and private ventures;
they attracted over 100,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> of capital from private investors.
The people working in the branches got personal shares. We drew up contracts.
There was still complete freedom in making investments and withdrawals and
the cooperative did not lay down any restrictions. Subsequently when the
county government learned about this, it wanted to see the contracts. After
seeing them, it approved the formation of partnerships. The original cooperative
was changed into the head cooperative of the district, and the various townships
set up branch cooperatives. Excluding the branch cooperatives, the head
cooperative again increased share capital by 2,629 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, making
a new total of 11,645 <B><I>yuan</I>. </B>The current account for the head
and branch cooperatives together was 158,350 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and the gross
profit 18,250 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Expenses were 8,895.13
<B><I>yuan</I></B> and the net profit was 9,354.07 <B><I>yuan</I>. </B>The
dividend per share was 0.10 <B><I>yuan</I>, </B>including the branch
cooperatives. Having set up branch cooperatives, the head cooperative was
strong enough to establish productive undertakings. In 1940 in partnership
with the Guanghua Store, we bought mules and set up a transport team, benefiting
from cooperation with private individuals. The original capital of the transport
team was 5,000 <B><I>yuan</I>. </B>By the end of the year, it had expanded
to have 160 mules and was regularly transporting salt goods. We also set
up a textile mill and a leather-workshop. The West District Cooperative and
the Xinmin Cooperative at Dufuchuan collectively set up a transshipment warehouse
and two felt-workshops at Qilipu. At first shares were taken out on an individual
basis so that there could be several cooperative members within one family.
Later this became troublesome, so they were combined, taking the household
as the unit. Each family became one cooperative member, and there was a total
of 853 members.
<P>
After the membership had been combined in this way households had 300-500
<B><I>yuan</I></B> to 1,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> invested. At the same time,
small merchants and porters from other counties had also joined the branch
cooperatives with share capital of 10,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. In particular
the porters who came frequently from the counties of Luochuan, Fuxian, Ansai,
Bao'an and Sanbian invested in the cooperative. When the dividend was paid
in the ninth month we held a meeting of members' representatives and reported
on the reasons for the expansion of the cooperative. After examination we
put forward the general aims for future work. First we wanted to increase
shares by 30,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and we asked the representatives to guarantee
that this would be done. Secondly, we planned to accept local products and
to sell them on behalf of the people, to supply the people with all daily
necessities, and to take responsibility for buying goods from other areas.
Thirdly, the salt, matches, and ploughshares needed by the people of the
district would not be bought from outside but would be supplied by the
cooperative. We reckoned that the 7,135 people of the district consumed 2
<B><I>qian</I></B> of a salt per head per day and 4.5 <B><I>jin</I></B> per
head per year, making an annual total of 32,107.5 <B><I>jin.</I></B> At a
price per jin 1 <B><I>yuan</I></B> below the market-price, we could save
over 32,100 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Each family used five packs of matches per
year, a total of 8,675 packs for the whole district. At a price per pack
5 <B><I>yuan</I></B> below the market-price, we could save 43,375
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The district used 1,500 ploughshares per year. At 15
<B><I>yuan</I></B> below the market-price we could save 22,500
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The total saving for these three items could be 98,050
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The district population's annual consumption of cotton
cloth for making clothes was 7,000 bolts. Each bolt required 25
<B><I>jin</I></B> of raw cotton, a total requirement of 17,515
<B><I>jin</I></B>. The total value was 3,500,O00 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. If the
yarn was spun by the people, they could earn half of it, that is, 1,750,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. We reported on our plans to the members at this meeting.
After approval by the members, we increased the number of machines for spinning
and weaving by peasant women.
<H4>
  Ninth period
</H4>
<P>
In August 1941 we increased share capital in the form of shares taken out
as government bonds for national salvation [<B><I>jiuguo gongzhai</I></B>].
The government mobilized the people to buy government bonds for national
salvation. The amount of bonds to be taken out by the people was added on
to their share capital. The dividend on this share capital was paid towards
the government bonds of 33,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. In this difficult situation
for the people, we helped them ease their burdens and raised their faith
in our ability to do so.
<P>
The now share capital was 33.070 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Combined with the old,
this gave a total of 44,715 <B><I>yuan</I></B> for the head cooperative.
The share capital for the various branch cooperatives was 120,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> and for the transport team it was 80,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> The combined total was thus 244.715 <B><I>yuan</I></B>
and the membership was 1,018. The current account for the head and branch
cooperatives together was 1,161,840.70 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and the gross profit
was 284,317.40 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Expenses were 138,849.30
<B><I>yuan</I></B> and the net profit was 145,469 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. The
dividend per share of 1 <B><I>yuan</I></B> was 0.70 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. When
issuing the dividend we proposed that each dividend of 0.70
<B><I>yuan</I></B> could be valued at 1 <B><I>yuan</I></B> if invested as
share capital. This increased members' trust and a lot of the dividend was
added on to the share capital. People taking out additional share could use
local products, firewood and grain as money, calculating the value higher
than market price. For example, each <B><I>jin</I></B> of grass was valued
0.20 <B><I>yuan</I></B> higher than the market-price. This was true of all
investment in kind and it also increased the people's trust.
<H4>
  
  Tenth period
</H4>
<P>
In 1942 we set up a sock-weaving factory. When we began propagandizing for
share capital, we made each share worth 20 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and presented
the members with a pair of socks. Afterwards, with the increase in the cost
of raw cotton, we raised the value of each share to 40
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The total share capital was 30,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. We set up the sock-weaving factory and it now has six
machines. In Yan'an city we set up the Yunhe transshipment warehouse with
420,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> share capital. At Songshulin we set up a branch
cooperative with share capital of 340,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. The surplus
accumulated by the transport team increased its capital to 750,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The head and branch cooperatives expanded their share
capital by 1,232,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, making a new total 2,520,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The membership was 1,112 (each member represented one
household). The largest investor had shares to the value of 5,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. There were nineteen units of the cooperative within the
boundaries of the district (including production, transport, and consumption).
Apart from the cooperatives, there was no other private commerce. Southern
district is 60 <B><I>li</I></B> long and 40 <B><I>li</I></B> broad. It has
1,544 households with 7,128 people. Altogether there are 1,469 oxen, 635
donkeys, 60 horses, 22 mules, and 4,445 sheep. Arable land covers 54,408
<B><I>mu</I></B> The wheat harvest was 872.5 <B><I>tan</I></B>. The harvest
of coarse grains was 9,084.16 <B><I>tan,</I></B> equivalent to 5,662.43
<B><I>tan</I></B> of hulled grain. The output from subsidiary undertakings
was equivalent to 334.25 <B><I>tan</I></B> of hulled grain. The full total
was 6,869.18 <B><I>tan</I></B>. In 1942 we paid 2,480 <B><I>tan</I></B> of
grain tax leaving 4,389.18 <B><I>tan</I></B>. The average amount of grain
per head was 0.6 <B><I>tan</I></B>. Animal fodder totalled 1,500
<B><I>tan</I></B>.
<P>
This spring the government mobilized to get 34,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> for
educational expenses and for sentry fees for the self-defence army, 8,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> for share capital for production at Gaomaowan, and 20,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> for bank savings bonds. The total was 62,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> to be raised in three parts. Each time each household
would have to attend a meeting for collection and loose the work of one of
its members. This would happen three times and each time the work of 1,500
would be lost. The work of each person was valued at 30
<B><I>yuan</I></B> so the total loss of earnings would be 135,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. Added to the 62,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> the full burden
on the people would have been 197,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Therefore the
cooperative paid the 62,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, on behalf of the people,
saving the 135,000 <B><I>yuan </I></B>which would have been lost. We helped
the people's production at a particularly busy agricultural time. We also
handed over 1,050 packs of salt each worth 240 <B><I>yuan</I></B> as salt
tax on behalf of the people. The total value of this was 252,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. Reducing the amount of work time lost by the people
influenced their attitude towards the cooperative, and we increased share
capital by 420,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. We plan to pay next year's salt tax
on their behalf.
<P>
We organized 600 peasant women to do spinning. Each day each person spun
2 liang of yarn. The total of raw cotton spun each day was 75
<B><I>jin</I></B> and the people should get half of it. Each
<B><I>jin</I></B> of yarn was reckoned as worth 150 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. The
profit per day was 5,250 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and the profit for the year was
1,890,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. This year they spun 5,000 <B><I>jin</I></B>
of raw cotton. In the first half of the year cotton was low-priced. Combining
both halves each <B><I>jin</I></B> cost 70 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. The people
earned 2,500 <B><I>jin</I></B> of raw cotton, equal to 175,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The cooperative arranged advances of 20,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> for spinning-wheels. After deducting this 20,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, the people earned 155,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Now we
are expanding the amount of spinning done by women. In the past there was
no spinning done in Southern district. Now large numbers of women are taking
part, but there are problems of raw materials. Finally, this year we sold
20,000 <B><I>jin</I></B> of charcoal for the people at 2
<B><I>yuan</I></B> per <B><I>jin</I></B>. The people got 400,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
The above facts relate what the cooperative has done. We have not divided
out the dividend so far this year on account of the floods. The cooperative
has lost 58 buildings with a value of 400,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, equipment
worth 300,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, goods worth 400,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>,
and the Fuchang Storehouse at a value of 200,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Total
losses were 1,300,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. The Government later helped us
borrow 500,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and we went to Dingbian county three times
to sell goods making a gross profit of 300,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. At present
we again have repair expenses of 240,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and we are expanding
share capital.
<P>
As regards the organization of the cooperative, each village elects one or
two representatives. Cooperative affairs are handled by the twelveman management
committee held on the sixth day of each month. All questions concerning
management and cadres are determined at the management committee meetings.
<H4>

&nbsp;The above document leaves a gap of two years between the eighth and
ninth periods, and there seem to be some omissions. Inquiries were made and
the following report came back:
<h4>
  
  CONCERNING THE PROBLEM OF PERIODIZATION OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT COOPERATIVE
</h4>
<P>
Operations began in December 1936 and the first meeting of all cooperative
members was held after three months. Altogether three such meetings were
held at three-monthly intervals. Then they were changed to once every six
months and a further three meetings were held. After the sixth meeting, there
was a gap of eight months and then the first meeting of representatives was
held (at the end of 1939). Afterwards the second meeting of representatives
was held in July 1940, and the third in August 1941. We planned to hold the
fourth meeting in July this year but because of floods it was difficult to
draw up the accounts so we extended the period. Before 1939 the period between
meetings was short and all the members attended. This was because our scope
and membership were both small. Later, meetings of representatives were held
once a year because our membership was too large, our undertakings had expanded
and drawing up accounts was not easy.
<P>
In our previous report we omitted to refer to the second representative meeting
of July 1940 and so the eighth period was lengthened into two years.
<P>
The previous report was made without proper drafting. If there are still

<P>
&nbsp;Below is the report of the comrades of the Yan'an county Party Committee
on the Southern District Cooperative. It is reproduced here for study.
<h4>
  
  THE EXPERIENCE OF THE LIULIN DISTRICT<BR>
  (i.e. YAN'AN SOUTHERN DISTRICT)<BR>
  COOPERATIVE
</h4>
<P>
Looking at the process of development of the Liulin District Cooperative
we can see:
<P>
(1) Cooperative operations are not limited to consumption but are also related
to production, credit and transport, making them a coherent whole. The head
cooperative and its branches make a total of sixteen.
<P>
On the production side there is the textile-mill, the leather-workshop, the
felt-workshop, the oil-pressing shop, and the flour-mill.
<P>
On the transport side there is the transport team with over a hundred animals.
The cooperative's capital investment is 500,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
Because the Liulin District Cooperative operates by uniting several economic
functions together, its scope is wide, its capital is large, its activities
are big, its development is fast, and it has solved many problems in the
supply of daily commodities for the people. Other cooperatives in this county
are limited to consumption. Compared to a cooperative which also carries
out production and transport, their capital and scope are small and their
development retarded.
<P>
(2) The policy for management of cooperatives by the people was put forward
by adopting the experience of Liulin. This cooperative's share capital expanded,
absorbed the capital of small merchants and drew them into take part in the
work. All the work of the cooperative was discussed and decided by the
cooperative members. The people were deeply involved with the cooperative.
They did not consider it to be run by officials but by themselves.
<P>
(3) The cooperative solves problems in the supply of daily necessities for
the masses, such as bolts of cloth, salt, matches, ploughshares, etc. at
lower than market-price. Taking matches and salt alone, the annual savings
for the people was more then 80,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Naturally the people
wish to buy things at the cooperative. The cooperative can supply the entire
needs of the people of Liulin district in these four daily necessities.
<P>
(4) The cooperative helps the masses out of urgent difficulties such as those
created by marriages or funerals by allowing them to borrow funds temporarily,
either giving credit against bolts of cloth or taking something as a pledge.
It sets a time limit for repayment. This fills the role of a credit cooperative,
solving major difficulties for the people. Because the cooperative does this
at a time of urgent need when no help can be found elsewhere, it creates
trust among the people, who consider the cooperative really helps them.
<P>
(5) The cooperative has a variety of ways of expanding share capital:
<P>
(i) Buying shares with ready cash.
<P>
(ii) Taking out shares in return for goods: a chicken, a pair of shoes, some
sheepskins, some hemp ropes can all be exchanged for shares at equivalent
value.
<P>
(iii) Absorbing the capital of small merchants.
<P>
(iv) Helping the masses pay burdens from the government and making this a
way of taking out shares. After the government issues its demand, the cooperative
turns them into a call for buying shares (to the same amount) and itself
pays the taxes. For example, in 1942 the people of the district had to pay
250,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> to the government as a cash substitute for tax
salt. This was treated as share capital and paid to the cooperative. The
cooperative paid the salt tax to the government, making a profit from the
handling of the cash. The people also got a dividend. Government bonds, education
costs, sentry costs, and so forth were collected in this way and paid by
the cooperative. The government was paid, the cooperative's share capital
increased and its operations expanded. The people profited and they had less
troubles. They also received dividends as shareholders.
<P>
(v) Increasing share capital through making timely responses to the needs
of the moment of the people. For example, when they wanted to expand spinning
and weaving, they put forward the slogan of raising share capital to do so.
In 1941 the cooperative experimented with paying tax grain for the people.
For each tan of the previous year's grain tax the people bought shares for
cash. The cooperative used the cash to expand its operations. In the following
year when the grain tax was allocated among the people, it was paid by the
cooperative from the profits it had obtained. This was done for forty or
so households, for whom paying grain tax was almost like not paying. They
became share holders in the cooperative, able to get a dividend every year.
They were very happy, their enthusiasm for production increased and they
got even more grain.
<P>
(vi) Paying a dividend on taking out shares. People taking out shares for
40 <B><I>yuan</I></B> were issued a pair of socks valued at 20
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. In this way the people were encouraged to buy shares.
<P>
(6) The cooperative is in a very good geographical position since it is in
Liulin district which is close to the large commercial market in Yan'an.
Liulin has much forest land. Many people sell timber and charcoal, which
raises their income and thus there is a lot of liquid capital in the villages
which can be absorbed in the purchase of shares. At the same time, being
near a market, the turnover of capital is very quick. These are objective
factors.
<P>
(7) The scope of the cooperative's activities is very wide. It has established
relations with the Border Region Bank, the Guanghua Store and the various
official organizations in Yan'an. Sometimes it can borrow capital or do a
lot of work for the official organizations and the cooperative has been able
to develop through this mutual help.
<P>
(8) The cadres have not been transferred much and they pay attention to
investigation and research. Director Liu has not been transferred to other
work since he was appointed. He has been able to concentrate exclusively
on his work, research and on thinking of ways of doing things. At the same
time, he also pays great attention in investigating objective conditions.
For example, he often investigate such things as the annual consumption per
individual bolts of cotton, salt, matches and so forth so as to solve the
people' s problems.
<P>
Here is an example to show the relationship between the cooperative and the
people. In 1941 the peasant Bai Da of Lufengpo in Liulin district had to
hand over 60 <B><I>yuan</I></B> for nations salvation grain tax. Beforehand
he paid it to the cooperative as share capital. At the appointed time the
cooperative paid the government on his behalf. Later the dividend was add
to the original capital of 60 <B><I>yuan</I></B> bringing it up to 200
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. He bought four ploughshares from the cooperative and
saved 15 <B><I>yuan</I></B> on each (that is, they were sold at 15
<B><I>yuan</I></B> less than the market-price), making a total saving of
60 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. He bought five packs of matches saving 5
<B><I>yuan</I></B> on each, a total of 25 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. At the end
the twelfth lunar month in 1941, he bought goods worth 1000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> at the cooperative but only paid 500
<B><I>yuan</I></B> saving 500 <B><I>yuan. </I></B>Subsequently, the market
prices of these goods rose by 550 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Including the previous
purchases of ploughshares and matches he saved a total of 635
<B><I>yuan.</I></B> Originally he had to pay 60 <B><I>yuan</I></B> in grain
tax, now it has become share capital of 200 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and he saved
635 <B><I>yuan</I></B> on the purchase of goods. This has really made the
cooperative belong to the people, facilitating their dealings and looking
after their interests. There are many examples like this.

Within six months capital increased by 833,167.14 <B><I>yuan</I>. </B>The
fastest increase in capital was in the branch cooperatives, which are directly
organized by the people with the support of the district cooperatives. Therefore
the people are very enthusiastic about taking shares.
<P>
The average taken from 1,290,000 <B><I>yuan</I> </B>works<B> </B>out 20
<B><I>yuan</I> </B>per head of the population of the county. This is not
much, so the role of the cooperatives in the entire county is still a minor
one.

<I>Important experience</I>
<P>
(1) Persist in the policy of management by the people and non-interference
by the government. We inspected the cooperatives in July this year and called
for an increase in share capital. Substantial capital should be held by the
co-operatives .
<P>
(2) Cooperative cadres should not be lightly transferred to other posts.
Let them be settled in their posts, concentrating on their work. Guarantee
their livelihood. Cooperatives should adopt the method of assigning personal
shares <I>[da Shenfen]. </I>That is, each member of the cooperative's personnel
should be equivalent to a number of shares depending on his ability and work.
For example, if someone is made equivalent to shares of 5,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, he is paid the interest due on shares of 5,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> at the time of settling accounts. This becomes his salary
and he does not receive any other income.
<P>
(3) Enlarging the scope of cooperative undertakings should not be limited
to consumption alone but should include production, transport, credit and
so forth. This is an inevitable trend in cooperative development henceforth.
That is to say, we must run comprehensive cooperatives.
<P>
(4) Concentrate on making a good job of one or two cooperatives and gaining
experience. Gradually expand to other areas. For example, we are preparing
to turn the Songshulin Cooperative of Jinpen district into a second Liulin
Cooperative.
<P>
These are opinions on our future work.
