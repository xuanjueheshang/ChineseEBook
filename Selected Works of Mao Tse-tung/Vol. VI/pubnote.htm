  PUBLISHER'S NOTE
</H1>
<P>
An authentic compilation of Mao's Collected works is long over due. Especially
now, its need is all the more great and urgent. But there is very little
hope of such a publication being brought out officially by the CPC. However,
several writings of Mao, not covered by the CPC's official publication i.e.,
<I>Selected Works of Mao Tse-Tung</I> Volumes 1 to 5 -are available elsewhere.
All these lie scattered in a number of english editions by western scholars
and in some remote research journals etc. We do realise that even if all
these are put together it will not be the collected - works nor will even
be a good substitute. Yet we hope their presentation at one place,
chronologically arranged, will certainly facilitate easy and ready reference,
further stimulating the study of Mao's works. Hence this venture.
<P>
Many more works might have certainly remained in Chinese and even some available
in English may have remained out of our reach. To come to the works included
in this volume, we have neither the means nor the competence to vouch safe
about their authenticity and completeness. We appeal to the readers to bear
these inevitable limitations in mind while, using this book. Due to these
and other reasons if any errors crept into this publication, we earnestly
hope to rectify them in future editions. We fondly hope that much more additional
material could come to light enabling us to substantially improve on this.
<P>
As far as possible all these writings are arranged strictly chronologically. Except indicating the primary source quoted in the originals, no attempt
is made to annotate or edit the texts in any respect or in any manner.
<P>
We mention our sincere thanks and acknowledgements to all the pioneers who
translated, edited and published these works in different forms earlier.
We whole heartedly extend our thanks to all these comrades-- the respected
scholars and loving friends -- whose unstinted co-operation and painstaking
efforts contributed in a big way to the success of this venture.
<P>
We feel very happy that this volume could be brought out despite many odds.
We hope to bring out the other volumes also soon. We fondly hope our effort
will be well rewarded by the warm and enthusiastic response of our esteemed
readers.
