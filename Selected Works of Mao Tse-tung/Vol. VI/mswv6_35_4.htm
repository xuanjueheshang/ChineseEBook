  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE ANTI-JAPANESE WAR
</h1>
<P>
<h4>
  4. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF HANDICRAFTS
</h4>
<P>
Handicrafts in the Border Region exist in two forms. The majority are subsidiary
family undertakings and a proportion are independent handicrafts. The largest
is the spinning and weaving undertaken by women. However. for many years
past a large proportion of local yarn and local cloth has been displaced
by foreign yarn and foreign cloth. Only recently. because of our encouragement,
has there been some resurgence. Even so the peasants of the Border Region
still want to take their surplus products, skins , and salt-transport trade
to outside regions in exchange for large amounts of foreign yarn and foreign
cloth. Their own spinning and weaving industry is still far from sufficient
to supply their own needs. I shall therefore take textiles as the key popular
handicraft for discussion here. In addition I shall deal with silk and
oil-pressing, ignoring others for the moment.&nbsp;
<H4>
  
  SPINNING AND WEAVING
</H4>
<P>
The people, the troops, and official personnel need 250,000 bolts of coarse
cloth per year (each bolt is 2 feet 4 inches wide and 100 feet long [Chinese
measurement].) Of this, the amount required by the troops and official personnel
is roughly 50,000 bolts, and that by the people 200,000 bolts. What is the
present supply? The seven publicly-run textile mills produce approximately
11,000 bolts per year. The seven large and small textile cooperatives run
by the people produce roughly 18,000 bolts per year. There are no statistics
for the amount of local cloth produced by the women at home, but it is estimated
to be around 30,000 bolts per year. Public and private annual production
totals 100,000 bolts, 150,000 bolts less than the amount needed. That is
easy to say, we can already supply 40 per cent of our needs, which is a great
achievement. But we are still 60 per cent short, and meeting this is our
future task. This task is very great. and we shall need several years to
complete it. But it can be done if we rely on, improve and expand the existing
textile enterprises run by the government and by the people. If we have the
raw cotton, we can in a planned way encourage the women to spin yarn and
to weave cloth made half of local yarn and half of foreign yarn. Gradually
we can reduce the import of foreign yarn, until eventually we reach the position
where we use only our own yarn to weave cloth. In this way we can solve the
problem.
<P>
As regards weaving, the responsibility rests first with the publicly-run
mills. In 1942 publicly-run textile mills were capable of producing 11,000
bolts of cloth. This could supply almost half of the needs of the troops
and official personnel. In a few more years we can be completely self-sufficient.
Second, we must encourage women to weave cloth as a popular industry. In
the Suide sub-region the women can already produce more than 30, 000 bolts
per year. However, the widths and lengths are not uniform. The people do
not like to buy it. They still prefer imported cloth. If improvements can
be made, there are good prospects for increasing the production of cloth.
Third, the people's cooperatives can already produce 18,000 bolts per year.
This can be further developed. We must rely on the combination of these three
forms to provide the cloth required by the Border Region. However in the
first place the greatest problem is the supply of yarn. At 12
<B><I>jin</I></B> of yarn per bolt, we need 3 million <B><I>jin</I></B> to
weave 250,000 bolts of coarse cloth entirely from local yarn. If we use a
mixture of half local yarn and half foreign yarn, we will need 1,500,000
<B><I>jin</I></B> of local yarn and 150,000 bundles of foreign yarn. At present
the cloth woven by publicly-run mills and the people's cooperatives is made
from this mixture of half local and half foreign yarn. However, there is
still not enough local yarn. We must greatly expand the amount of spinning
done by the people, and improve the quality of the yarn. Therefore it is
extremely important for the Border Region to gradually expand handicraft
spinning and weaving among the people, to increase the quantity, and too
improve the quality.
<P>
How should we gradually solve these problems? In the light of past experience,
we propose the following methods.
<P>
(1) First we should reorganize and expand spinning and weaving among the
people in the counties of the Suide special military area. The way to do
this is, under the direction of the special office of the military area,
to unite the efforts of the commodities Bureau and the Daguang Yarn Factory
of 359 Brigade, issuing raw cotton to women and ordering them to produce
more local yarn to supply the yarn needs of the publicly-run cloth factories.
This method was effectively implemented in 1942. It should be continued and
expanded in 1943. Apart from supplying yarn to the publicly-run cloth factories,
the people of the special military area may weave cloth themselves. The
Commodities Bureau can determine measurements and quality, and guarantee
a market. That is, the cloth can be purchased by the Commodities Bureau either
for its own use or for selling among the people. Next, the government should
invest 1 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> in order to increase the quantity of
local yarn. Based on the experience of the Southern District Cooperative
of Yan'an county which organized spinning by women in 800 households, lending
funds to 3,000 households in Yan'an and Ansai will increase the number of
spinning-machines in the two counties by 3,000 in 1943. Organizing spinning
by women in 1,000 households in Qingyang and Quzi counties will increase
the number of spinning-machines by 1,000. These credit funds can be handled
by the Commodities Bureau, which can issue raw cotton and spinning-machines.
It can purchase the local yarn produced to supply the needs of the publicly-run
factories. Next, in order to increase cloth production the government should
invest a further 1 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> either as loans or as share
capital in the existing cloth-weaving cooperatives run by the people as a
means of expanding their undertakings.
<P>
Here we should consider the plan for Yan'an county. In their <B><I>Plan for
Production and Construction </I></B>in 1943, the comrades in Yan'an say:
<P>
In 1943 we shall increase the number of women able to spin and weave by 40,000.
Estimating that they will be able to spin 18 <B><I>jin</I></B> of yarn each
in a year (11/2 <B><I>jin</I></B> per month ), this gives a total of 72,000
<B><I>jin</I></B>. In addition, there were already 1,000 women able to spin
in 1942. Each year one of these can spin 20 <B><I>jin</I></B>, giving a total
of 20,000 <B><I>jin</I></B>. The two groups can together spin 92,000
<B><I>jin</I></B>, which can be woven into 8,363.6 bolts of cloth. However,
this is still 4,886.4 bolts short of our needs. He plan to solve this problem
within two or three years, and to achieve complete self-sufficiency. The
population of this county is 64,000 (excluding the city of Yan'an). Of these,
42,000 are adults. Each adult needs one-quarter of a bolt of coarse cloth
per year (a suit of plain clothes requires 11 feet of cloth and half a suit
of padded clothes requires 14 feet of cloth, a total of 25 feet; each bolt
of coarse cloth is 100 feet long). Their total requirement is therefore 10,500
bolts. The 22,000 young people each need half the quantity of cloth required
by an adult. A bolt of cloth is enough for eight and their total requirement
is 2,750 bolts. The annual requirement for the whole county is thus 13,250
bolts.
<P>
The 92,000 <B><I>jin</I></B> of yarn spun in 1943 will be woven into 8,366.6
bolts of coarse cloth. This requires 56 looms (each loom can weave 150 bolts
of coarse cloth per year ) . In 1942 there were twelve looms in the villages
and factories of this county. Thus we must expand the number in the village
by forty-four during 1943 using the cooperative structure. There are three
methods for doing this. The first is investment (i) in incentive awards to
encourage women to spin, 50,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> (ii) in producing 5,000
<B><I>jin</I></B> of raw cotton at 100 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per
<B><I>jin,</I></B> 500,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, and (iii) in expenses for
spinning and weaving-equipment, 1,000 spinning-wheels at 100
<B><I>yuan</I></B> each, 100,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, and 44 looms at 1,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> each, 44,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. The total required for
the above items is 694,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Second, looms in the villages
should be set up by the peasants organizing themselves into partnerships.
The government can help them overcome their difficulties by training skilled
workers, or by investing capital for looms and so forth. Third, for every
2 <B><I>jin</I></B> of raw cotton issued, 1 <B><I>jin</I></B> of yarn should
be collected. The cotton cloth woven in the villages may be used by the peasants
themselves. The Gaodan Yarn Spinning Factory should play the leading role
in encouraging women to spin, and in training workers.
<P>
This plan by the comrades in Yan'an is really worth looking at. If the people
of Yan'an, who lack experience of spinning and weaving, are able with the
encouragement of the Party and government to become fully self-sufficient
in yarn and cloth within two or three years, other counties without experience
should also be able to solve the problem within a similar or slightly longer
period. We hope that the comrades in the various counties will all make such
a plan. As for the various counties where the peasants have experience, such
as the special military area, the problem should be solved even more easily.
According to the calculations of the comrades in Yan'an, adults make up
two-thirds of the population and children one-third. One bolt of cloth is
enough for four Adults or eight children. Therefore, the yearly cloth requirement
for the 1,400,000 population of the Border Region is not 200,000 bolts but
337,500. According to the opinions of the comrades in Yan'an a large quantity
like this can be provided within two or three years. In sum, by relying on
the masses setting-to and on the leadership of the Party and the government
any difficulty can be overcome.
<P>
(2) The Reconstruction Department should do research into the people's
experiences in spinning in order to improve the quality of local yarn so
as to prepare to produce Border Region cloth entirely from local yarn, gradually
reducing and ultimately stopping the import of foreign yarn. If the quality
of yarn cannot be improved then we cannot suspend dealings in foreign yarn.
<P>
(3) Improve the woolen goods made by the publicly-run factories. Using woolen
goods in place of some of the cotton clothing and bedding used by the army
is a way of reducing the consumption of cotton cloth.
<P>
(4) In 1943 official personnel should set a personal example and wear local
cloth without exception. At the same time they should encourage the people
to use more local cloth and less foreign cloth. According to the situation
in the development of local cloth, the Commodities Bureau can gradually limit
the import of foreign cloth.
<P>
The above methods will help us gradually to solve the great problem of
self-sufficiency in cotton cloth. Although it can only be done gradually,
it is nevertheless entirely possible. We must resolutely implement all methods
for doing so.
<H4>
  
  COTTON - SEED OIL
</H4>
<P>
In 1942 the peasants of the counties planting cotton harvested around 3 million
<B><I>jin</I></B> of cotton seeds capable of giving 360,000
<B><I>jin</I></B> of oil, and, with the expansion in cotton-planting, from
5 to 6 million <B><I>Jin</I></B> of seed can be obtained next year which
can further increase the quantity of oil. We should prevent all this being
wasted. Cotton-seed oil is edible but the peasants of the Border Region are
still not accustomed to it. If the government does not promote it, they will
not extract the oil. Therefore the government of the Border Region should
invest 300,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and, through the governments of the counties
where cotton is planted. encourage the peasants to experiment with pressing
cotton-seed oil. After the experiments succeed, it can be widely promoted.
The oil can be bought by the government. This will not only provide edible
oil but also at present oil prices of 30 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per
<B><I>jin</I></B> give the peasants an income of 10,800,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> from 360,000 <B><I>jin</I></B> of oil.
<H4>
  
  SILK
</H4>
<P>
In the counties of Suide, Qingjian, Anding, Yanchuan, Gulin and so forth
many peasants rear silkworms. It is a relatively large subsidiary undertaking.
For example, in Anding alone there were 3,585 peasant households rearing
silkworms during 1942. They harvested 23.662 <B><I>jin</I></B> of silkworm
cocoons, at a value of 600,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
Our sewing and repair industry needs silk thread and our woolen-blanket industry
needs silk edging. We. can also use silk thread for the woof when weaving
cotton cloth as a means of reducing the import of foreign yearn. Therefore,
we should develop the silk production of the Border Region. The way to do
this is for the government to issue 300,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> in credit
to the peasant families to expand the rearing of silkworms. Credit should
be given especially to those peasant households which have a good record
in rearing silkworms. Moreover, the commodities Bureau should buy the peasants'
silk through the local cooperatives and order woven-silk articles from the
peasants in order to promote the expansion of the silk industry.
<P>
The total investment in the above three undertakings, spinning and weaving,
oil-pressing, and silk, is 2,600,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> (yarn spinning 1
million, cloth-weaving 1 million, oil-pressing 300,000 and silk 300,000).
Although these funds are not great, they can stimulate the people to progress
a little in solving the urgent needs of the moment. In 1943 when we have
even more experience, we should consider increasing the amount of capital.
Spinning and weaving are particularly important. Unless the people set-to
and the public sector helps, the problem cannot be solved as a whole.
<P>
Here I have only taken up spinning and weaving, oil-pressing, and silk. Other
items have not been mentioned. The counties can according to actual
circumstances, do research into handicrafts which are related to the people's
economy and which need stimulus from the Party and the government, and they
can make their own plans.
