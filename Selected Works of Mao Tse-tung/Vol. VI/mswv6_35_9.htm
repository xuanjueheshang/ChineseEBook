  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE ANTI-JAPANESE WAR
</h1>
<P>
<B>9. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRODUCTIVE UNDERTAKINGS OF OFFICIAL ORGANIZATIONS
AND SCHOOLS</B>
<P>
Within the three branches of the public sector of the economy, production
by the troops and by the official organizations and schools is directly intended
to meet their own living and running-costs. Production by government organs
is also included in this. For example, the personnel working in the various
departments and offices of the Border Region government run agricultural,
handicraft and commercial undertakings. These directly supplement deficiencies
in the running-expenses of the organs and in clothing, bedding and food for
the personnel. By contrast the salt industry, industry and agriculture
established as government enterprises are not intended to provide
running-expenses but to meet the needs of the whole Party, government and
army.
<P>
In Yan'an and the Border Region, the official organizations of the Party
and government, leading organs of the mass organizations and many schools
have pursued agriculture industry and commerce under the slogans 'set-to
ourselves' and self-reliance'. This is a broad mass-movement, and it has
solved many big problems of finance and supply. It is only just second to
the army's production and it is worth our while to sum up its experience
carefully, to point out its achievements and shortcomings and to determine
the work-plan for 1943.
<P>
The army's production movement began in 1938 and gained some experience.
In 1939 we spread this experience into all official organizations and schools.
In February 1939 we held a Production Mobilization Conference. We organized
production committees to be leading organs for the production movement and
we stipulated different production tasks according to the different circumstances
of the work and study of each official organization and school and the strength
of their labour form. For example, we laid down that working personnel in
district; and townships should be fully self-sufficient in grain and other
organizations from the centre down to the county should be either one-half
or one-third self-sufficient according to the strength and size of their
labour force. In total we asked them to open up 100,200 <B><I>mu</I></B>
of land and to harvest 13,000 <B><I>tan </I></B>of hulled grain. Besides
this we decided that all official organizations and schools should be entirely
self-sufficient in vegetables, should raise pigs for meat and should use
the straw from their crops to provide part of the fodder for horses. At the
time there were roughly 200,000 people in the official organizations and
schools of the whole Border Region. We issued average production expenses
of 2. 60 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per head, a total of offer 49,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. This provided capital to buy plough-oxen and agricultural
tools. After they had found land and bought oxen and tools everyone was mobilized
for the spring ploughing. Most of these people were intellectuals and youths
who had never previously taken part in production. Together with cadres from
worker and peasant backgrounds and service personnel, cooks and grooms, they
were organized into production groups to open up the land. All hilltops near
Yan'an with unused land became covered with men and women opening them up.
They automatically showed labour discipline and declared competitions in
clearing land. The strong took up hoes and the weak grew vegetables and raised
pigs, or took food and water to the workers.
<P>
The gains from this production movement were: (i) the official organizations
and schools of the whole Border Region opened up 113,414 <B><I>mu</I></B>
of land, harvested 11,325.63 <B><I>tan</I></B> of grain (equivalent to 5,830.17
<B><I>tan</I></B> of hulled grain) and harvested roughly 1,200,00
<B><I>jin</I></B> of vegetables. At prevailing market-prices the two harvests
were worth over 368,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> (over 10,179,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> at 1942 prices). This provided one-quarter of the grain
requirements of 20,000 people, one-half of the horse fodder and some of the
vegetables and meat. (ii) It enabled over 10,000 intellectuals and young
people to understand from their own experience what physical labors is. This
tempered them. (iii) When the common folk of the Border Region saw or heard
that all working personnel and young students in all the Party and government
official organizations &#151; from Party Central Committee members to young
service personnel&#151;were all going up into the mountains to farm, they
were moved. Everyone was keen to open up land and it became an exceptional
year for doing so.
<P>
On the other hand, the stipulated task for grain productions was not fulfilled
in this year because of lack of labour experience and because the application
of manure, seed planting and weeding was not done at the right time. Also,
in some areas there was drought and so forth. As a result, although a lot
of land was opened up, the harvest was not large and only 45 per cent of
the original grain target of 13,000 <B><I>tan</I></B> of hulled grain was
achieved. Secondly the error of egalitarianism was committed in leadership
and organization. The different nature of each organization and school was
not considered. Some were given tasks that were too great such as the call
for district and township cadres to be self-sufficient in grain. In fact
they only achieved one-quarter. Some put off and spoilt their work or study
in order to carry out production with the result that it was uneconomic.
In some cases male and female comrades, physically too weak to do hard work,
were forced to labour and their health suffered. Some units could in fact
have undertaken industry and commerce but this was not pointed out at the
time, and they purely and simply concentrated on agriculture.
<P>
In 1940 we corrected these shortcomings. First we reduced the agricultural
production tasks. Apart from self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat, we
stipulated that the official organizations and schools should be only from
one-seventh to one-sixth or one-quarter self-sufficient in grain according
to their different circumstances. We did not ask weak males nor any females
to do physical labour. No person over fifty or under fifteen took part in
production. We permitted the hiring of experienced peasants to join-in or
to direct production. In addition the Finance Department issued 50,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> to the official organizations and schools as capital to
allow them to undertake industry and commerce and to develop animal husbandry,
raising pigs and sheep. Therefore in agricultural production during 1940
we did not increase cultivated land beyond the existing amount. Some units
lacked labour power and adopted the meshed of taking ordinary folk on as
tenants. Some gave part of their grain-producing land to others and concentrated
on planting vegetables and raising pigs. In addition some schools moved to
other places in north China. Therefore the 1940 harvest only amounted to
3,000 <B><I>tan</I></B> of hulled grain and 900,000 <B><I>jin</I></B> of
vegetables, worth 3 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> at the market-prices of the
time.
<P>
The commerce we ran began with cooperatives. In 1939 each official organization
and school had a consumers' cooperative and some had opened restaurants.
By the first half of 1940 there were thirty cooperatives and restaurants
with more than 60,000 guest capital. The largest had 10,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> and the smallest not more than a few hundred
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. Their aim was to supply daily necessities for the
organization or school itself. At the same time they sold to outsiders for
a slight profit as a means of improving their livelihood. They had still
not become commercial undertakings to meet general needs. However, they gave
initial tempering to cadres ruling commerce, and accumulated some commercial
experience and a small amount of capital.
<P>
In the two years of 1939 and 1940, the organizations and schools generally
did not undertake industry. They only set up some flour mills for their own
needs and the rear services. Jiaotong set up a smithy for horseshoes. These
can be considered the beginnings of their handicraft production.
<P>
The above was the first period in self-sufficient production for the
organizations and schools. Below we turn to the second period.
<P>
In the winter of 1940 the production tasks of the organizations and schools
rapidly changed as a result of the economic blockade of the Border Region,
the cutting-off of outside aid, the extreme financial difficulties, and the
unavoidable need to move quickly from semi-self-sufficiency to full
self-sufficiency in finance and supplies.
<P>
At the time (with the exception of the troops) the various organs of the
Party, government, army and mass organizations and the personnel of the schools
could not all take up agriculture and the task of achieving self-sufficiency
was extremely difficult. On the one hand we wanted to rely on developing
production to ensure daily and monthly supplies. At the same time we wanted
to accumulate capital to establish a foundation for future self-sufficiency.
<P>
In order to get through this difficult situation, the Party had government
adopted necessary steps. First we improved the organizations for leading
production. In succession we established the Finance and Economy Office directly
under the Central Committee, the Rear Services Economic Construction Office,
the Finance and Economy Office at top level in the Border Region Government,
and ordered each sub-region and county to set up production committees. Second,
between the winter of 1940 and the spring of 1941 the government paid out
700,000 <B><I>yuan </I></B>and the Border Region Bank lent 3 million
<B><I>yuan</I></B> to increase the production capital of the various branches.
This was handed to the various bodies leading self-sufficient production
for issuing downwards, to be added to the capital accumulated by the
organizations themselves in the first period. Thereupon everyone made new
arrangements, selected personnel, chose undertakings put industry and commerce
to the fore.
<P>
Agriculture was then placed in a subordinate position.
<P>
Below we shall discuss the experience of' the various organizations and schools
in industry, commerce and agriculture during this period.
<P>
The starting point for the industry of the organizations and schools was
textiles. Since the Border Region had wool, the personnel of the organizations
and schools spun wool by hand after work and study during the winter of 1940.
For a while it became a movement and everybody began to spin. But since there
was not enough raw material and spinning skills were poor, the woolly threads
were uneven, and too much labour was wasted. After March 1941 this was gradually
stopped and we applied ourselves to setting up handicraft textile mills.
In the first half of 1941 each large organization and school selected service
personnel and messengers to go to the Refugee Textile Mill run by the government
to study spinning and weaving. Like bamboo shoots after spring rain, more
than ten textile mills grew up within a short time. The shortcoming was that
there was no planning. By the latter half of the year because they had no
ensured supply of raw materials or market for yarn, or because they lacked
sufficient liquid capital or were poorly administered, some had closed, some
had merged and some had temporarily closed. For example, the Xin Zhongguo
Textile Mill of the Finance and Economy Office directly under the Central
Committee first merged with the Shengli Mill of the Central Organization
Department and then merged with the Tuanjie Mill run by the Marxism-Leninism
Institute. Then using the name of Tuanjie Textile Mill, it was run in a
centralized way and got more profit. The wool-spinning factory run by the
Lu Xun Academy and the Women's University was closed down and its capital
used elsewhere. The Tuanjie Textile Mill of the Financial and Economy Office
under the Central Committee and the Jiaotong Mill run by the Rear Services
could not fully employ their production capacity because of all kinds of
difficulties. They alternately worked and closed down for a while until they
eventually got on the right track. Thus the process of moving from a
hand-spinning movement of several thousands of people to the setting up of
handicraft factories, from the setting up of over ten small textile mills
and wool-spinning factories to the final merger into two factories, the Jiaotong
and the Tuanjie, was a process of moving from blindness to consciousness
in which there was continuous groping forward through research, improvement
in techniques and improvement in administration. This process on the one
hand illustrated the hard-working spirit of the various organizations and
schools and on the other illustrated our complete lack of experience in running
industry at that time. By 1942 the Jiaotong produced 3, 336 bolts of cloth
and the Tuanjie produced 2,736, becoming major factories in the Border Region.
They are the valuable creation of the process of hard work and groping the
way forward.
<P>
Besides textile mills, the organizations and schools directly under the Central
Committee have successively set up many handicraft factories for such things
as bedding and clothing, shoes, coal and charcoal, carpentry, papermaking,
pottery, flour-milling and oil-pressing, silk weaving and making iron implements.
Their aim has been self-sufficiency. The capital for these factories came
either from commercial capital, or from bank loans, or from the closure of
the wool-spinning factories. Warned by the experience with textiles, these
factories were not run in such an entirely disorganized way. They were rather
more orderly With several organizations and schools cooperating, or with
cooperation with the common folk or with the Bank. But it was not all plain
sailing. Most only laid a firm foundation after following a winding path
from initial loss of capital through continued support to final profit.
<P>
In the years 1941 and 1942, the system under the Central Committee's Finance
and Economy Office [<B><I>Zhong-cai xitong</I></B>] set up a total of
twenty-seven large and small handicraft factories with total capital of over
400,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and with 477 employees. Among them there were
eight textile mills with 217,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> capital and 161 employees,
three coal and charcoal factories with 70,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> capital
and sixty-eight employees, three mills with 15,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> capital
and twenty-one employees, two bedding and clothing factories with forty-eight
employees (capital details not available), three carpentry factories with
35,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> capital and seven employees, one shoe factory with
10,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> capital and thirty-eight employees, and one papermaking
workshop with 20,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> capital and twenty-nine employees.
In addition there were six small factories individually producing machinery,
glass, alcohol, pottery, oil-lamps and blankets. (There are no statistics
on capital and employees for these factories. The first three were experimental
undertakings by the Natural Sciences Institute.) All the above factories
were reorganized in September 1941 when the official organizations and schools
directly under the Central Committee carried out their first drive for better
troops and simpler administration. They were transferred to the direct control
of Central Administration Bureau (the Finance and Economy Office directly
under the Central Committee was dissolved and we set up the Central
Administration Bureau attached to the Central Work Department
[<B><I>Zhongyang Bangongting</I></B>]). Their number was reduced from
twenty-seven by closure or merger to nineteen. In particular the merging
of the eight textile mills into two, the Tuanjie and the Shiyan, enabled
concentration of management and improvement in operation. Thus we were able
to move from a situation where eight mills either lost capital or just maintained
themselves to one of a profit of 1,600,0000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> in October
1942.
<P>
Self-sufficient industry run by the Rear Services system was started in the
winter of 1940 just like that run by the central financial system. After
two years' operation, 1941 and 1942, there was one textile mill, two papermaking
factories, three charcoal factories, two carpentry factories, two silk-weaving
factories, and one factory each for coal [shitan], refined salt, pottery,
bedding and clothing, writing-brushes, ironwork, flour-milling, shoes and
hemp-weaving, a total of nineteen altogether. There are no statistics yet
for the amount of capital, number of employees and amount of production of
these factories. Although the profit earned by these undertakings is not
great (in the first ten months of 1942 it was 200,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>), their great merits are:
<OL TYPE="i">
  <LI>
    they are run in a centralized war by the Rear Services and are not run freely
    in a dispersed way as by the various official organizations and schools.
    Thus leadership and inspection are thorough, and mistakes are quickly corrected.
  <LI>
    They constitute a wide range of operation. Unlike the Central Committee's
    Finance and Economy Office system's initial concentration on textiles through
    the establishment of eight factories, the Rear Services has at all times
    only run one factory, the Jiaotong Textile Mill, and thus had spare capacity
    to do other things.
  <LI>
    They are entirely aimed at ensuring supplies. Although they do not earn money,
    they have provided a supply of many necessary goods.
</OL>
<P>
In October 1942 we carried out a thorough drive for better troops and simpler
administration. The Central Administration Bureau and Rear Services systems
were combined, and their industries administered in a unified way. We also
carried out further reorganization. The Tuanjie and Jiaotong textile mills
and the bedding and clothing factories were transferred to the Finance
Department. The medicine, alcohol, iron, and glassmaking factories were
transferred to the Garrison Office. The Natural Sciences Institute and all
the things that went with it were handed over to the government. All remaining
factories were closed, or merged and handed over to the control of the Central
Administration Bureau. By December 1942 there were three carpentry factories,
two papermaking factories, five charcoal-factories, one shoe-factory, one
oil-pressing factory, one flour-mill, three grinding-mills, one cart-factory,
one wine-factory and three blanket-workshops, a total of twenty-one large
and small handicraft factories and workshops. These can ensure all supplies
of coal, shoes and flour, the manufacture and repair of all wooden and
galvanized-iron implements, and some of the paper and edible-oil requirements
for the whole of the Central Administration Bureau system. Bedding and clothing
are supplied by the government. This is the outcome of the activism in industrial
production over the past two years of the Central Administration Bureau (prior
to September 1941 the Central Committee's Finance and Economy Office) and
the Rear Services.
<P>
The above experience shows that under present circumstances it is essential
for the official organizations and schools to run handicrafts. The aim is
not to earn money but to ensure supplies of necessities. However, organizations
and schools cannot set up any kind of factory they want to. They should choose
in a planned way which ones to run, according to the nature of the industry
and the situation in the official organization or school. They should reduce
the number of errors created by blindly groping around. Existing factories
should be organized into systems according to area and official organization.
Cutbacks, mergers and transfers can reduce waste and enable them to play
an even greater role in providing supplies.
<P>
As mentioned above, our comrades lacked experience of running commerce in
the same way as they did of running industry. They had previously only managed
a few cooperatives. We wished to turn to relying on a profit from commerce
in order to provide a large proportion of supplies. What had to be done?
Once again it was a process of moving from blindness to consciousness in
order to find an answer to this question.
<P>
During 1941 and 1942 commerce started off with the aim of rapidly overcoming
difficulties. Therefore we had no choice but to use the bulk of the capital
of each official organization and school to trade for a quick profit.
<P>
In the year from autumn 1940 to autumn 1941 we mainly operated large stores.
Some official organizations and schools enlarged their existing low-capital,
small-profit cooperatives, small shops and stalls, increasing capital and
staff, joining chambers of commerce and running proper commercial undertakings.
For example, the Jiaotong Store of the military base was at first a small
cigarette-shop set up at the entrance to the base at Qilipu in Yan'an. In
August 1939 it moved to the new market in Yan'an and as well as selling general
goods set up a Chinese Medicine shop and a horseshoe-shop. Its capital increased
from a few hundred <B><I>yuan</I></B> to 20,000 <B><I>yuan.</I></B> Another
example is the Hezuo Store which grew from the cooperative of the Anti-Japanese
University. In June 1940 it moved to the new market and set up branch stores
at the three branch schools of the Anti-Japanese University. Its capital
increased from 80 <B><I>yuan</I></B> to 19,000 <B><I>yuan.</I></B> The Rear
Services Store was at first a small stall with 30 <B><I>yuan</I></B> capital.
By September 1940 it had expanded and its capital had grown to 20,000
<B><I>yuan.</I></B> As well as selling goods it also set up a dyeing shop.
Originally many official organizations and schools did not have shops. Around
this time they too collected capital and people together and set up business
either independently or in partnerships. At the time the business done by
all the publicly-run stores depended on trading goods mainly from Suide,
Dingbian and Fuxian counties, in particular the cloth, paper, writing-materials
required by the official organizations, schools and troops themselves, and
the matches, raw cotton and so forth required by the common folk. During
this period the official organizations and schools set up over sixty large
and small stores in Yan'an, Suide and Dingbian, not including those run by
the army. In addition, there were many that did not set up premises but depended
on one or two people and a few animals to trade goods along the roads, calling
it 'floating trade'. According to statistics for October 1941 the stores
under the control of the Rear Services' committee for store administration
were the Xibei Store, the Xibei Vegetable Cooperative, and fourteen large
and small stores including the Xinghua, the Hezuo, the Jiaotong, the Xinxin,
the Xingmin, the Minxing, the Biahuo. the Junmin, and so forth. The Central
Administration Bureau had twenty stores.
<P>
We really relied on commerce to pass through a serious crisis during that
year. It solved great problems of supply. For example, during the first half
of 1941 the Central Committee's Finance and Economy Office and the official
organizations and schools relied on the twenty large and small stores run
by 113 staff with 296,800 <B><I>yuan</I></B> capital to earn a profit of
256,000<B><I> yuan </I></B>which supplied 48 per cent of their daily
running-expenses. The Rear Services system with capital of 706,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> made 810,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> profit in the same period
which supplied 45 per cent of their daily running-costs.
<P>
However commerce during this period had one great fault which was excessive
dispersal and no centralized leadership. Furthermore, almost all of it was
trade in general goods. These faults came from the urgent need to solve
difficulties in running-costs for each official organization and school.
Each acted without coordination, competed with others and even disobeyed
Party policy, influencing prices and currency. Simultaneously. there was
price inflation, the Border Region banknotes lost value and the external
blockade intensified. Suddenly dealing in export and import of general goods
had a gloomy future and the various official organizations and schools which
relied on this for their running-expenses also found themselves with problems.
In this situation. it was urgently necessary to transform the commerce run
by the official organizations and schools and by the army. This transformation
began in the latter half of 1941. In the spring of 1942 the Border Region
carried out an initial drive for better troops and simpler administration.
It was then decided to organize all commerce into proper enterprises
[<B><I>qiyehua</I></B>]. On the one hand each system put its existing stores
in order, organized a joint committee for publicly-run commerce, unified
the leadership of publicly-run stores, and strictly carried out laws, commands
and policies. On the other hand they expanded the scope of commercial activity,
carrying out many kinds of business such as salt-shops, mule and horse supplies,
transshipment agencies, merchant warehousing, slaughtering and so forth.
The method of operation also changed. In some cases stores were merged, in
others capital was invested in private stores or in cooperatives and the
official organization or school did not run its own trade. In other cases
capital was invested in the government's Salt Company or in the Guanghua
Store. Thereafter the fault of having too many shops competing with each
other was avoided, and the function of providing the running-costs of the
official organizations and schools could be restored. For example, as a result
of reorganization according to this policy the Central Administration Bureau
and Rear Services systems reduced the number of their shops from thirty-eight
with 196 staff to twenty-five with 105 staff by October 1942. In the first
ten months of 1942 the two systems earned a profit of 16,440,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> with capital of 8 million <B><I>yuan.</I></B> This accounted
for 68 per cent of all production income. Also during 1942 the production
committees of the various departments and offices of the Border Region Government
earned 600,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> from agriculture and commerce, of this
commerce accounted for 350,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> or 58 per cent. Official
organizations at sub-region and county level originally put agriculture first
but by 1942 commerce was the most important.
<P>
In 1943 financial and economic leadership will be united
[<B><I>yiyuanhua</I></B>]. External trade will be unified under the Commodities
Bureau. Every official organization and school must carry out a thorough
drive for better troops and simplified administration. As a result the commerce
run by the official organizations and schools must be regulated by the
Commodities Bureau, must share in running transport for local products and
salt, and must allocate some capital for cooperation with the Commodities
Bureau. In this way publicly-run commerce will be more rational.
<P>
The agricultural production of the official organizations and schools also
made progress in 1941 and 1942. In these two years there were great achievements
in the areas of grain, vegetables, charcoal and labour after work.
<P>
Some official organizations and schools were still growing grain entirely
independently in 1941, some had already changed to forming partnerships with
the common folk, and some ran agricultural stations (including both independent
operation and partnerships). Independent operation had changed somewhat.
The entire personnel no longer went up the mountains to farm. Instead, those
who went were chiefly those doing miscellaneous duties organized into production
teams accompanied by some of the physically stronger personnel. For example,
the production teams of the various official organizations in the Rear Services
system planted 5,200 <B><I>mu</I></B> of grain in 1941, and the Central Party
School planted 800 <B><I>mu</I></B>. Those in partnership with the common
folk included the Central organization Department which planted 840
<B><I>mu</I></B> and divided the grain at a ratio of 2:8, 2 to the government
and 8 to the private individuals, and the hay at a ratio of 7:3, 7 to the
government and 3 to the individuals. The agricultural stations included the
two stations run by the Secretariat of the Border Region Government on a
partnership basis. There were also the independent stations run at Nanniwan
by teams selected from the miscellaneous duties personnel of the official
organizations and schools equipped with oxen and tools. These included two
from the Rear Services and one each from the Central Committee's Finance
and Economy Office, the Central Organization Department and the Youth League
cadres. Official organizations of the sub-regions and counties also adopted
both independent operation and partnerships.
<P>
In 1942 the drive for better troops and simpler administration was carried
out. Many official organizations and schools in Yan'an were merged. As a
result, self-supporting vegetable production continued but all grain production
was only carried out either at agricultural stations or in partnerships.
<P>
Although partnerships have some of the character of exploitation, the common
folk, in particular the immigrants and refugees, appreciate it very much
since the government supplies seed, plough oxen and agricultural implements,
and the taxes are not high. This method has a role to play in encouraging
immigration and in adjusting the use of labour power. The Party School provides
an example:
<P>
The general office of the Party School planted 300 <B><I>mu</I></B> in
partnership with four immigrants. These four were all very strong. The Party
School sent one man responsible for leadership and inspection, The arrangements
were for the Party School to supply the agricultural tools, a hoe, a pick
and a sickle per man, to lend two oxen and to give the seed. They also lent
grain at rate of 4 <B><I>sheng</I></B> of hauled grain per 3
<B><I>mu</I></B> making 4 <B><I>tan</I></B> for 300 <B><I>mu.</I></B> It
was agreed to repay in the autumn of the following year. The division of
the grain and hay harvest was laid down as 20 per cent of the spiked millet
[<B><I>gu (zi)</I></B>] for the government and 80 per cent for the private
individuals, 30 per cent of coarse millet [<B><I>Meiji</I></B>] for the
government and 70 per cent for the private individuals, and 40 per cent of
the miscellaneous grains for the government and 60 per cent for the private
individuals. All the hay went to the Party School. This year the Party School
received 10,500 <B><I>jin</I></B> of hay, 8.37 <B><I>tan</I></B> of spiked
millet, 10.17 <B><I>tan</I></B> of coarse millet, 6.9 <B><I>tou</I></B> of
black beans [<B><I>heidou</I></B>] 4.2 <B><I>tou</I></B> of hemp-seed
[<B><I>xiao mazi</I></B>], l <B><I>tou</I></B> of sesame [<B><I>lao
mazi</I></B>] and 2 <B><I>tou</I></B> of adzuki beans
[<B><I>xiaodou</I></B>], valued at a total of 31,925 <B><I>yuan</I></B> in
Border Region money. The four partners received 33.48 <B><I>tan</I></B> of
spiked millet, 22.4 <B><I>tan</I></B> of coarse millet, 7.5
<B><I>tou</I></B> of black beans, 6.3 <B><I>tou</I></B> of hemp-seed, 1.5
<B><I>tou</I></B> of sesame, and 3 <B><I>tou</I></B> of adzuki beans, valued
at a total of 46,805 <B><I>yuan</I></B> This is a good example of giving
consideration to both public and private interests.
<P>
There is also new experience in building up agriculture stations. Since the
personnel selected from the official organizations and schools are not strong
labour powers, have limits on their working-time and are not skilled in
agricultural techniques, they will waste their capital if they only concentrate
on farming. In 1942 we adopted the following two methods. One was independent
operation which includes subsidiary undertakings such as animal husbandry,
wood-plank sawing and so forth as well as planting grain. This was like the
method adopted by 359 Brigade. The other was to form partnerships and involved
going into partnership with the common folk on stations that already had
some foundation, and setting up another new station oneself. In the first
year the new station brings no profit but in the second year it has some
foundation and can also be changed into a partnership. The Secretariat of
the Border Region Government provides an example. According to the comrades
there:
<P>
We have two stations, one to the east, the other to the south. Their size,
method of operation and harvest are much the same. In 1942 the southern station
planted 288 <B><I>mu</I></B> of river land, 324 <B><I>mu</I></B> of previously
farmed hill land and 408 <B><I>mu</I></B> of newly opened land. Altogether
the harvest was 244 <B><I>tan</I></B> of grain. Since beans and corn formed
the bulk, this was equivalent to 146.6 <B><I>tan</I></B> of hulled grain.
Taking each <B><I>tan</I></B> at 1,300 <B><I>yuan</I></B> this was worth
190,230 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. We also harvested 14,000 <B><I>jin</I></B> of
hay worth 14,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and 20,000 <B><I>jin</I></B> of vegetables
worth 20,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> The total value for these three items was
224,320 <B><I>yuan</I></B> Originally we had 128 sheep. In 1942, eighty-one
lambs were raised, worth 10,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. We bought pigs for 3,482
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, and we also had thirteen worth 400 <B><I>yuan</I></B>
each. The total of all the above items is 243,002 <B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
As we have adopted the method of partnership operation all our expenditures
were taken from the amount harvested including all expenses for the five
men we assigned. We went into partnership with twelve households, totaling
forty-five people. They had nineteen whole-labour powers, thirteen half-labour
powers and thirteen children not able to work. Altogether their share was
68 <B><I>tan</I></B> of grain equivalent 40.8 <B><I>tan</I></B> of hulled
grain with a total value of 53,040 <B><I>yuan</I></B> at 1,300
<B><I>yuan</I></B> per <B><I>tan</I></B>. They also received 7,000
<B><I>jin</I></B> of hay worth 7,000 <B><I>yuan.</I></B> The two items came
to 60,040 <B><I>yuan.</I></B> Our own five men (one was crippled and looked
after general running, two cooked, planted vegetables and crops, and two
looked after sheep and did general work ) four oxen, one mule and five dogs
received 30 <B><I>tan</I></B> of grain for eating equivalent to 18
<B><I>tan</I></B> of hulled grain worth 23,400 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and 50
<B><I>jin</I></B> of edible oil worth 1,300 <B><I>yuan</I></B> at 26
<B><I>yuan</I></B> per <B><I>jin</I></B>. In addition, repairs to implements,
ploughs, clothing and supplementary payments came to 20,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The total of all the above expenditure was 104,740
<B><I>yuan</I></B> giving a surplus of 138,262 <B><I>yuan.</I></B> Adding
on the roughly 110,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> from the eastern station, the return
on the two stations was roughly 250,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
The two stations are nominally run by the Secretariat and the Civil Affairs,
Finance, Education and Reconstruction Departments. In practice, they only
send out ten people of whom two are hired labourers, one is a cripple and
seven are surplus personnel. The government has a production committee to
control the two stations. In practice usually only one person runs things.
This year thanks to floods and strong winds we were 150 <B><I>tan</I></B>
short on our harvest, worth 117,000 <B><I>yuan.</I></B> We were also swindled
on the seeds we bought for turnips and cabbage which were the wrong kind.
This lost 30,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. These two items came to 147,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> and total losses for the two stations were roughly 200,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. This means that without natural disasters and the wrong
seeds we could get 200,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> more. The working personnel
in the Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, Reconstruction Departments and
the Secretariat number around 400. The income of 250,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> is thus an average of 625 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per head.
Although the harvest this year is below norm, they have laid the foundations
for next year and provided a livelihood for twelve immigrant households.
Furthermore, relying on this foundation, next year we are preparing to expand
the ploughed land at the southern station by 900 <B><I>mu</I></B> so as to
settle down surplus personnel. The two original stations will still be run
as partnerships.
<P>
The method adopted by the county-level official organizations also include
both individual operation and partnerships. For example, the top-rank official
organizations in Yan'an county have planted a total of 630
<B><I>mu</I></B>. Of these over 270 <B><I>mu</I></B> are farmed in partnership
with two households. These have five labour powers and the county committee
has only assigned two people to work on the station. The remaining 360
<B><I>mu</I></B> are farmed by criminals. In 1942, excluding the amount
distributed to the partners, they received a total of 75
<B><I>tan</I></B> of grain, equivalent to 45 <B><I>tan</I></B> of hulled
grain with a value of 58,500 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. With the addition of hay
worth 3,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, the total was 61,500<B><I> yuan.</I></B>
<P>
As the above examples show, independent operation, partnerships and a combination
of both are correct. We should pay attention to this experience when determining
the grain production tasks for 1943.
<P>
A very great task in agricultural work is the growing of vegetables since
grain is also provided by the grain tax. If vegetables are not grown then
over 20,000 people will be semi-starved. The saying 'no vegetables is like
half a year's famine' is completely true.
<P>
The method for producing vegetables in the past two years has been to assign
personnel specially for growing them and to assign some supplementary labour
from the official organizations and schools. Each year we have on average
been self-sufficient for three to six months. According to the Rear Services
statistics in 1941 their various official organizations and schools planted
1,801 <B><I>mu</I></B> of vegetables consisting of 1,030 <B><I>mu</I></B>
of potatoes and 771 <B><I>mu</I></B> of cabbage, beans, turnips and miscellaneous
vegetables. In autumn, autumn cabbage and autumn turnips were planted on
the 771 <B><I>mu.</I></B> Over the year 879,000 <B><I>jin</I></B> of vegetables
were harvested equal to one-third of annual consumption on average. According
to the Central Administration Bureau statistics, in 1942 the various official
organizations and schools directly under central control assigned forty personnel
for growing vegetables and planted 388 <B><I>mu</I></B> of river land and
1,941 <B><I>mu</I></B> of hill land. They harvested 745,000
<B><I>jin</I></B> of vegetables, being self-sufficient for five months on
average. The Central Administration Bureau itself supplied nine months of
its needs. Yan'an University and the Natural Sciences Institute both supplied
eight months of their needs, and the Central Research Institute and the Chinese
Writers Anti-Aggression Association [<B><I>wen-Kang</I></B>] both supplied
seven months of their needs. The circumstances for vegetable production by
the personnel in the various official organizations are very varied. For
example, in Guanzhong sub-region they can only plant a little on account
of the climate, and can only achieve three months' self-sufficiency on average.
In the special military area they can only reach two or three months'
self-sufficiency because of the scarcity of land. In some areas such as Huachi,
Mudan and other counties they can achieve six months' or more because they
have land and can farm in partnerships. Production of vegetables for their
own use by official organizations and schools throughout the Border Region
is estimated to be worth around 6 million <B><I>yuan.</I></B>
<P>
The problem here is to discern whether the method whereby the official
organizations and schools assign production personnel to grow vegetables
outside their permanent organizational structure is ultimately worthwhile
or not. The experience of the various offices under central control shows
that it is. The best land for growing vegetables is river land, where all
kinds of green vegetables can be grown. On hilly land only potatoes and beans
can be grown. One <B><I>mu</I></B> of river land growing vegetables can supply
five people for a whole year, that is 0.2 <B><I>mu</I></B> per person. However,
1.5 <B><I>mu</I></B> of hill land is required to supply one person for one
year. Furthermore, so long as a man specializing in growing vegetables has
additional help when spreading manure, he can farm 6 <B><I>mu</I></B> of
river land. This means that one man specializing in growing vegetables together
with some supplementary labour can supply a year's vegetables for thirty
people. The daily vegetable requirement per head is 12
<B><I>liang</I></B> and the annual requirement is 300 <B><I>jin.</I></B>
For thirty people the annual requirement is 9,000 <B><I>jin.</I></B> At December
1942 Yan'an market prices of 3 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per <B><I>jin</I></B>,
the total value of this is 27,000 <B><I>yuan.</I></B> Allowing 6,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> for the man specializing in growing vegetables there is
a surplus of 21,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Taking the necessary incentive payments
into account, the least return is 20,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Therefore in
future after each official organization and school has carried out a thorough
drive for better troops and simpler administration, it should pay attention
to arranging river land for growing vegetables, to assigning personnel for
the work, to providing supplementary labour and to ensuring self-sufficiency
in vegetables for more than half a year and even for a whole year.
<P>
Apart from grain and vegetables, raising pigs and sheep for meat is also
an important part of agriculture.
<P>
Some people consider that raising pigs wastes grain. However, our experience
proves that raising pigs does not waste grain and, instead, not raising them
does. First of all, without pigs, leftovers have to be thrown away, and there
are quite a lot of leftovers in large official organizations and companies.
Secondly, if little meat is eaten then greater quantities of other food is
consumed, and if a lot of meat is eaten then less other food is consumed.
Thus, raising pigs to increase meat supplies is not only necessary to maintain
health but is also economically rational. The various official organizations
and schools have developed many ways of raising pigs. For example, the Central
Party School directed the pig slaughterhouse to send someone to the kitchen
daily to collect the water in which the grain was washed and the vegetable
waste to feed the pigs. The Central General Affairs Section
[<B><I>Zhongyang</I></B> <B><I>Zongwuchu</I></B>] directed someone to collect
as pig-food the waste left after husking the grain and also the leaves and
roots left over in the vegetable plots when the vegetables were harvested.
According to the Rear Services Department statistics, in the first half of
1941 its various official organizations got 56,814 <B><I>jin</I></B> of pork
worth 170,440 <B><I>yuan</I></B> at the market-prices of that time. This
was enough for each person to have 1 <B><I>jin</I></B> of pork a month. If
we add the following six months, the value for the whole year was roughly
350,000 <B><I>yuan.</I></B> According to the statistics of the Central
Administration Bureau, the various official organizations and schools directly
under central control raised an average of 2 65 pigs a month up to October
1942. Over the ten months this gave an estimated 23,330 <B><I>jin</I></B>
of pork worth 700,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> in Border Region currency. Another
example is the top-level official organizations in Yan'an county, which in
the first ten months of 1942 earned 10,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> from pig-raising.
According to these figures the total value of animal husbandry by the official
organizations and schools of the whole Border Region is more than 4 million
<B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
As well as raising pigs, raising sheep is also profitable where there is
pasture.
<P>
After a thorough drive for better troops and simpler administration in 1943,
we can adopt the method used by 359 Brigade whereby they assign one cook
for every forty people and reduce the service personnel. The remaining cooks
and service personnel are sent to work on the production front where they
can do many things such as growing grain and vegetables, and raising pigs
and sheep. Running large-scale animal husbandry on large livestock farms
should be given greater prominence in 1943.
<P>
Apart from the grain, vegetables and animals, there is also charcoal-burning
and labour done outside working hours, both of which have provided examples
worth looking at. All the charcoal used in the winter of 1942 by the various
official organizations and schools in Yan'an was provided by teams of people
from those institutions sent up into the hills. If it had been bought, a
substantial sum of money would have been involved. In September the Central
General Affairs Section organized a charcoal-burning team of forty-two people
made up of service personnel, cooks and grooms to spend three months up in
the hills making charcoal. Altogether they prepared 145 pits of charcoal
completing their task of making 140,000 <B><I>jin.</I></B> At 1.20
<B><I>yuan</I></B> a <B><I>jin</I></B> this was worth 168,000
<B><I>yuan.</I></B> If during the four winter months the 30,000 people in
the official organizations and schools of the Border Region on average made
1 <B><I>jin</I></B> of charcoal per head per day, this would provide 3,600,000
<B><I>jin</I></B> of charcoal worth 3,600,000 <B><I>yuan.</I></B> If we do
not make the charcoal ourselves, where shall we find such a large amount
of money?
<P>
There is also the labour done outside working-hours by the miscellaneous
duties personnel of the official organizations and offices of the Border
Region. For example, the Central General Affairs Section this year mobilized
them to repair buildings, to build surrounding walls, to make bridges, to
build roads and to cut horse-fodder. This saved the government over 110,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. Similar labour done by miscellaneous personnel of the
Central Party School saved the government over 139,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>; and 359 Brigade did not employ outside workers for any
of its repairs or new construction. All official organizations and schools
should strive to do the same. Mobilize all the people in an official organization
or school to do all the work they can do. If we only consider the labour
done after working hours by miscellaneous duties personnel, the amount from
all the official organizations and schools of the Border Region could be
surprising. We should give rewards to all people who make achievements in
production, and this should also apply to labour outside working-hours.
<P>
The above is a summary of the experience of the various official organizations
and schools of the Border Region in self-sufficient production during the
period 1939-42.
<P>
According to the comrades doing economic work, in the two years 1941 and
1942 the agricultural, industrial and commercial capital of the Central
Administration Bureau and the Rear Services Department rose from 1,281,917
<B><I>yuan</I></B> to 11,690,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> (much of this increase
was due to the fall in the value of the currency and it was not all due to
increased production). The production surplus of the year 1942 was 23,810,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. Except for the 2,330,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> retained
to increase production capital in 1943 the remaining 21,480,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> was all used to supplement food clothing, bedding and
office expenses for the various official organizations and schools. In terms
of the type of enterprise, agriculture accounted for 17 per cent, industry
8 per cent, salt 7 per cent and commerce 68 per cent. In terms of the official
organizations, the enterprises directly under the control of the Rear Services
Department got 8,400,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, those directly under the Central
Administration Bureau 3,500,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, those jointly run by
the above two 800,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, and those run by the various official
organizations and schools individually 11,100,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. If
we compare the amount of self-supporting production and the amount supplied
by the people, the former is 57.5 per cent and the latter 42.5 per cent.
The comrades at county level estimate that the monthly running-expenses for
Party and government at county level is roughly 10,000
<B><I>yuan.</I></B> Their own production is around 9,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> and the upper levels only issue around 1,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> The proportion is thus 90 per cent to 10 per cent and
is an even greater achievement.
<P>
In sum, the self-supporting production work of the official organizations
and schools of Yan'an and of the whole Border Region has had some success.
It has not only supplied the greater part of daily running-expenses and solved
urgent financial problems but has also laid a secure foundation for the public
sector of the economy. Relying on this base, we can continue to develop
production and solve future problems.
<P>
What is particularly important and worth raising is that we have gained
experience in running economic enterprises. This is a priceless treasure
that cannot be reckoned in figures. We should not only be able to manage
political, military, Party and cultural affairs, but should also be able
to manage economic affairs. If we could do all the others but not economic
work. we would be a useless bunch of people. We would be overthrown by our
enemies and decline until we collapsed.
<P>
In the light of our experience of the past five years and particularly the
past two, production by official organizations and schools must henceforth
improve, expanding its achievements. overcoming its weak points, developing
towards greater consolidation and completing even greater production tasks.
In 1943 we should adopt the following policies:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>
    Implement the policy of taking agriculture as the chief sector.
    <OL TYPE="A">
      <LI>
	According to the actual circumstances in the official organizations and schools,
	in each system adopt the following methods of running agriculture: (i) Those
	with no foundations in agricultural stations should at once set-to to prepare
	ploughs and tools, and separately or in partnership with the people grow
	grain and vegetables. (ii) Those with agricultural stations, as well as
	continuing production, should expand the scope of operations and arrange
	for surplus personnel to do more subsidiary work such as raising pigs, sheep,
	chickens and ducks, sawing planks and so forth. They should also form
	partnerships with the ordinary people and open new farms. With these methods
	grain production in 1943 will be greater and better than in 1942. Agriculture
	must not be considered backward and must not be neglected.
      <LI>
	All official organizations and schools, large and small, must allocate the
	necessary personnel to specialize in growing vegetables supplemented by light
	work done by working personnel and students. According to the area and climate
	become self sufficient in vegetables for six or more months of the year,
	and strive to become entirely self-sufficient. This is one of the most important
	steps in improving livelihood.
    </OL>
  <LI>
    Coordinate and develop the various kinds of handicrafts. According to the
    area, system and the principle of better troops and simpler administration,
    join the existing handicrafts of a similar nature run by each section into
    partnerships. At the same time, according to the needs of each area and each
    system, set up new handicraft workshops, such as oil-pressing workshops,
    places to make Soya sauce and condiments, charcoal pits and so forth. The
    principles for running these handicrafts should be first that the workshop
    itself must be self-supporting, and second that it can make a profit.
  <LI>
    Develop animal husbandry. All official organizations and schools both large
    and small should raise pigs and strive to equal 359 Brigade's rate of one
    pig for every five people, so as to increase the supply of meat. Treat increasing
    the supply of meat, improving living-standards and raising health-standards
    as extremely important matters. In addition, each large official organization
    and school, and particularly the army, should set aside capital and without
    harming the interests of the people select areas in Sanbian, Longdong, Jinpenwan
    and so forth to run livestock farms. They should raise large numbers of cows,
    sheep, donkeys and horses, preparing for the time after victory in the War
    of Resistance when the Border Region's salt trade declines and it has to
    be replaced by animal exports.
  <LI>
    Develop transport undertakings. After a thorough drive for better troops
    and simpler administration, keep only a small number of animals to ensure
    the transport of grain and straw needed by each official organization and
    school itself. All surplus animals together with animals specially purchased
    should be organized into transport teams to transport salt or goods. These
    transport undertakings can be run by area and system as the best way of reducing
    costs.
  <LI>
    Regulate commerce. Following the policy of commerce playing a supplementary
    role and the principles of not going against trading policies nor doing
    speculative business, run shops in partnerships or individually according
    to the circumstances in the various systems and units after the drive for
    better troops and simpler administration. Eradicate commerce which goes against
    policy and close unprofitable shops. The various systems should transfer
    the proportion needed from commercial capital to agriculture, animal husbandry,
    handicrafts and transport. Do not hesitate to lay secure foundations in the
    work of becoming self-supporting through agriculture, industry, animal husbandry
    and transport.
  <LI>
    Treat improving the livelihood of the working personnel, miscellaneous duties
    personnel and students in the official organizations and schools as an important
    matter. Responsible people in these institutions should think of all kinds
    of ways of doing so. Under the principle of voluntary participation, they
    should encourage and direct miscellaneous duties personnel, working personnel
    and mothers with children to carry out some handicraft or agricultural production
    in ways which do not hinder their work, study or health. However, they should
    not run commerce. This work can be carried out in large production cooperatives,
    in small production groups or individually as the people involved wish. The
    government should provide loans for capital and the earnings should belong
    to the people who take part in the labour. All responsible people who run
    this very well and have the best successes should get rewards. All those
    who are not good at running their official organizations and schools hence
    make the life of the working personnel, miscellaneous duties personnel, students,
    mothers, children, the sick and the convalescent too harsh, or those who
    improve livelihood through ways which are wrong, hinder-work and study, or
    sabotage policies and orders should be criticized and taken to task.
  <LI>
    Implement unified leadership. Firmly carry out the principle of unified
    leadership and dispersed operation. The top-levels of the central Committee,
    the Border Region, the special regions [<B><I>zhuangqu</I></B>] and the counties
    should all set up strong leadership organizations concerned with unifying
    all production undertakings. According to the system and level, unify the
    policies for running enterprises, unify the coordination between the enterprises,
    and unify the ways of inspecting the running of each enterprise. Furthermore,
    under the condition of permitting each production unit to retain a suitable
    profit for itself, within a suitable area to the nature of production and
    operation, unify the distribution of the profits from production. This is
    necessary to avoid the great evils of lack of coordination, of inequalities
    in profits and losses, and of disparities in hardship and comforts.
  <LI>
    All agriculture, industry, animal husbandry, transport and commerce must
    be run as proper enterprises [<B><I>qiyehua</I></B>], using the system of
    economic accounting. The food, bedding, clothing and payments for the working
    personnel and employees in each enterprise should be supplied by the enterprise
    itself. They must not be provided at public expense.
  <LI>
    All production organs (factories, shops, etc.) should be 'popularized' no
    matter whether they belong to the government, the troops or the official
    organizations and schools. With the exception of the allocation of production
    tasks, the administration and supervision of production and the disposal
    of the results of production, everything else is under the leadership of
    the local Party and government, even including branch life. All personnel
    in production organizations must carry out policies, be law-abiding and pay
    taxes, take off their uniforms and put on ordinary clothing, join in the
    activities of the local masses and be model citizens of the Border Region.
  <LI>
    In accordance with the concrete circumstances, the Finance and Economy Office
    and the financial and economic committees of the sub-regions should issue
    specific production tasks for 1943 to the official organizations and schools
    in each county system. They should investigate and examine the production
    plans, and enter all the results of production completed within the plan
    by these production units into the financial accounts. Surplus production
    beyond the plan should be retained by the unit for itself as a means of improving
    livelihood. Upper levels should issue supplements to units whose production
    is not enough Those that made a loss in 1942 should be quickly examined to
    find ways of making up the deficiency.
  <LI>
    The four shortcomings pointed out in Chapter 8, 'On the Development of the
    Productive Undertakings of the Troops', also apply to the official organizations
    and schools. All official organizations and schools committing similar abuses
    should pay attention to correcting them.
  <LI>
    It must be clearly explained to all personnel engaged in agriculture, industry,
    animal husbandry, transport, commerce and labour outside working-hours (including
    the ordinary people working as hired labour or in partnerships) that their
    work is for the revolution and they are part of a very glorious cause. Setting
    aside a portion of the income from their labour to hand over to the government
    all helps our own, glorious and sacred revolutionary cause. It does not increase
    the assets of any individual. If publicly employed personnel working in the
    public sector of the economy plot to make special profits for themselves,
    they are guilty of immoral conduct within our ranks and crimes of corruption
    before the law. Those who are entirely free of corruption and waste, and
    work loyally for the Party and the country, are considered noble and moral,
    and should receive praise and rewards from the Party and the government.
    This point should be explained to the troops.
  <LI>
    All people doing economic, financial, supply and general service work, so
    long as they are not corrupt, do not waste, are loyal and work for the Party
    and the country, should be honoured. All people who treat their work lightly
    or with disdain should be criticized and rebuked.<BR>
