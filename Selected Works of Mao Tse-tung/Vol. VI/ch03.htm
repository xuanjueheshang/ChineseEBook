<h3>
3. Guerrilla Warfare In History
</h3>

<hr class="end" />


<p>
Guerrilla warfare is neither a product of China nor peculiar to the present
day. From the earliest historical days, it has been a feature of wars fought
by every class of men against invaders and oppressors. Under suitable conditions,
it has great possibilities. The many guerrilla wars in history have their
points of difference, their peculiar characteristics, their varying processes
and conclusions, and we must respect and profit by the experience of those
whose blood was shed in them. What a pity it is that the priceless experience
gained during the several hundred wars waged by the peasants of China cannot
be marshaled today to guide us. Our only experience in guerrilla hostilities
has been that gained from the several conflicts that have been carried on
against us by foreign imperialists. But that experience should help the fighting
Chinese recognize the necessity for guerrilla warfare and should confirm
them in confidence of ultimate victory.
</p>
<p>
In September 1812, Napoleon, in the course of swallowing all of Europe, invaded
Russia at the head of a great army totaling several hundred thousand infantry,
cavalry, and artillery. At that time, Russia was weak and her ill-prepared
army was not concentrated. The most important phase of her strategy was the
use made of Cossack cavalry and detachments of peasants to carry on guerrilla
operations. After giving up Moscow, the Russians formed nine guerrilla divisions
of about five hundred men each. These, and vast groups of organized peasants,
carried on partisan warfare and continually harassed the French Army. When
the French Army was withdrawing, cold and starving, Russian guerrillas blocked
the way and, in combination with regular troops, carried out counterattacks
on the French rear, pursuing and defeating them. The army of the heroic Napoleon
was almost entirely annihilated, and the guerrillas captured many officers,
men, cannon, and rifles. Though the victory was the result of various factors
and depended largely on the activities of the regular army the function of
the partisan groups was extremely important. The corrupt and poorly organized
country that was Russia defeated and destroyed an army led by the most famous
soldier of Europe and won the war in spite of the fact that her ability to
organize guerrilla regimes was not fully developed. At times, guerrilla groups
were hindered in their operations and the supply of equipment and arms was
insufficient. If we use the Russian saying, it was a case of a battle between
"the fist and the axe" <em>[<B>Ivanov</B> ].</em>
</p>
<p>
From 1918 to 1920, the Russian Soviets, because of the opposition and
intervention of foreign imperialists and the internal disturbances of White
Russian groups, were forced to organize themselves in occupied territories
and fight a real war. In Siberia and Alashan, in the rear of the army of
the traitor Denikin and in the rear of the Poles, there were many Red Russian
guerrillas. These not only disrupted and destroyed the communications in
the enemy's rear but also frequently prevented his advance. On one occasion,
the guerrillas completely destroyed a retreating White Army that had previously
been defeated by regular Red forces. Kolchak, Denikin, the Japanese, and
the Poles, owing to the necessity of staving off the attacks of guerrillas,
were forced to withdraw regular troops from the front. 'Thus not only was
the enemy's manpower impoverished but he found himself unable to cope with
the ever-moving guerrilla' <em>[<B>The Nature of Guerrilla Action</B>].</em>
</p>
<p>
The development of guerrillas at that time had only reached the stage where
there were detached groups of several thousands in strength, old, middle-aged,
and young. The old men organized themselves into propaganda groups known
as 'silver-haired units'; there was a suitable guerrilla activity for the
middle-aged; the young men formed combat units, and there were even groups
for the children. Among the leaders were determined Communists who carried
on general political work among the people. These, although they opposed
the doctrine of extreme guerrilla warfare, were quick to oppose those who
condemned it. Experience tells us that 'Orthodox armies are the fundamental
and principal power, guerrilla units are secondary to them and assist in
the accomplishment of the mission assigned the regular forces <em>[<B>Gusev,
Lessons of Civil War</B>.]. </em>Many of the guerrilla regimes in Russia gradually
developed until in battle they were able to discharge functions of organized
regulars. The army of the famous General Galen was entirely derived from
guerrillas.
</p>
<p>
During seven months in 1935 and 1936, the Abyssinians lost their war against
Italy. The cause of defeat &#151; aside from the most important political
reasons that there were dissentient political groups, no strong government
party, and unstable policy&#151;was the failure to adopt a positive policy
of mobile warfare. There was never a combination of the war of movement with
large-scale guerrilla operations. Ultimately, the Abyssinians adopted a purely
passive defence, with the result that they were unable to defeat the Italians.
In addition to this, the fact that Abyssinia is a relatively small and sparsely
populated country was contributory. Even in spite of the fact that the Abyssinian
Army and its equipment were not modern, she was able to withstand a mechanized
Italian force of 400,000 for seven months. During that period, there were
several occasions when a war of movement was combined with large-scale guerrilla
operations to strike the Italians heavy blows. Moreover, several cities were
retaken and casualties totaling 140,000 were inflicted. Had this policy been
steadfastly continued, it would have been difficult to have named the ultimate
winner. At the present time, guerrilla activities continue in Abyssinia,
and if the internal political questions can be solved, an extension of such
activities is probable.
</p>
<p>
In 1841 and 1842, when brave people from San Yuan Li fought the English;
again from 1850 to 1864, during the Taiping War, and for a third time in
1899 in the Boxer Uprising, guerrilla tactics were employed to a remarkable
degree. Particularly was this so during the Taiping War, when guerrilla
operations were most extensive and the Ch'ing troops were often completely
exhausted and forced to flee for their lives.
</p>
<p>
In these wars, there were no guiding principles of guerrilla action. Perhaps
these guerrilla hostilities were not carried out in conjunction with regular
operations, or perhaps there was a lack of co-ordination. But the fact that
victory was not gained was not because of any lack in guerrilla activity
but rather because of the interference of politics in military affairs.
Experience shows that if precedence is not given to the question of conquering
the enemy in both political and military affairs, and if regular hostilities
are not conducted with tenacity, guerrilla operations alone cannot produce
final victory.
</p>
<p>
From 1927 to 1936, the Chinese Red Army fought almost continually and employed
guerrilla tactics contently. At the very beginning, a positive policy was
adopted. Many bases were established, and from guerrilla bands, the Reds
were able to develop into regular armies. As these armies fought, new guerrilla
regimes were developed over a wide area. These regimes co-ordinated their
efforts with those of the regular forces This policy accounted for the many
victories gained by the guerrilla troops relatively few in number, who were
armed with weapons inferior to those of their opponents. The leaders of that
period properly combined guerrilla operations with a war of movement both
strategically and tactically. They depended primarily upon alertness. They
stressed the correct basis for both political affaires and military operations.
They developed their guerrilla bands into trained units. They then determined
upon a ten year period of resistance during which time they overcame innumerable
difficulties and have only lately reached their goal of direct participation
in the anti-Japanese war. There is no doubt that the internal unification
of China is now a permanent and definite fact, and that the experience gained
during our internal struggles has proved to be both necessary and advantageous
to us in the struggle against Japanese imperialism. There are many valuable
lessons we can learn from the experience of those years. Principle among
them is the fact that guerrilla success largely depend upon powerful political
leaders who work unceasingly to bring about internal unification. Such leaders
must work with the people; they must have a correct conception of the policy
to be adopted as regards both the people and the enemy.
</p>
<p>
After 18 September 1931, strong anti-Japanese guerrilla campaigns were opened
in each of the three north-east provinces. Guerrilla activity persists there
in spite of the cruelties and deceits practiced by the Japanese at the expense
of the people, and in spite of the fact that her armies have occupied the
land and oppressed the people for the last seven years. The struggle can
be divided into two periods . During the first, which extended from 18 September
1931 to January 1933, anti-Japanese guerrilla activity exploded constantly
in all three provinces. Ma Chan Shan and Su Ping Wei established an anti-Japanese
regime in Heilungkiang. In Chi Lin. the National Salvation Army and the
Self-Defence Army were led by Wang Te Lin and Li Tu respectively. In Feng
T'ien, Chu Lu and others commanded guerrilla units The influence of these
forces was great. They harassed the Japanese unceasingly, but because there
was an indefinite political goal, improper leadership, failure to co ordinate
military command and operations and to work with the people, and, finally,
failure to delegate proper political functions to the army, the whole
organization was feeble, and its strength was not unified. As a direct result
of these conditions, the campaigns failed and the troops were finally defeated
by our enemy.
</p>
<p>
During the second period, which has extended from January 1933 to the present
time, the situation has greatly improved, This has come about because great
numbers of people who have been oppressed by the enemy have decided to resist
him, because of the participation of the Chinese Communists in the anti-Japanese
warm and because of the fine work of the volunteer units. The guerrillas
have finally educated the people to the meaning of guerrilla warfare, and
in the north-east, it has again become an important and powerful influence.
Already seven or eight guerrilla regiments and a number of independent platoons
have been formed, and their activities make it necessary for the Japanese
to send troops after them month after month. These units hamper the Japanese
and undermine their control in the north-east, while, at the same time they
inspire a Nationalist revolution in Korea. Such activities are not merely
of transient and local importance but directly contribute to our ultimate
victory.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
However, there are still some weak points. For instance: National defence
policy has not been sufficiently developed; participation of the people is
not general; internal political organization is still in its primary stages,
and the force used to attack the Japanese and the puppet governments is not
yet sufficient. But if present policy is continued tenaciously, all these
weaknesses will be overcome. Experience proves that guerrilla war will develop
to even greater proportions and that, in spite of the cruelty o the Japanese
and the many methods they have device to cheat the people, they cannot extinguish
guerrilla activities extinguish guerrilla activities in the three north-eastern
provinces.
</p>
<p>
The guerrilla experiences of China and of other countries that have been
outlined; prove that in a war of revolutionary nature such hostilities are
possible, natural and necessary. They prove that if the present anti-Japanese
war for the emancipation of the masses of the Chinese people is to gain ultimate
victory, such hostilities must expand tremendously.
</p>
<p>
Historical experience is written in iron and blood. We must point out that
the guerrilla campaigns being waged in China today are a page in history
that has no precedent. Their influence will not be confined solely to China
in her present anti-Japanese war but will be world-wide.
