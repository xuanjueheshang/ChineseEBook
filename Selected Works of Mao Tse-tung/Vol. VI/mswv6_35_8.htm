  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE ANTI-JAPANESE WAR

<P>
<h4>
  8. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRODUCTIVE UNDERTAKINGS OF THE TROOPS
</h4>
<P>
Which of the three branches of the public sector of our economy -- the
government, the army and the official organizations -- is ultimately the
most important in terms of directly meeting requirements most quickly and
in greatest quantity? Our experience of the past few years shows that it
is the army. The army's productive undertakings have become the most important
part of the public sector of our economy because the army is the body which
is relatively most organized and has most labour power. So long as it has
no direct fighting duties, it can use all its time outside training, doing
work. And under our present backward technical conditions, labour is the
decisive factor in economic undertakings.
<P>
The production movement in the garrison forces of the Shaan-Kan-Ning Border
Region began in 1938, and one year before that in the official organizations
and schools. A joint production movement of the army and official organizations
and schools together began in 1939. In 1940, 359 Brigade took on the duty
of defence on the Yellow River and joined in the production movement. In
1941 and 1942, the army increased its responsibility for self-supporting
production just like the official organizations and schools. However, the
tasks taken on by the army were greater and occupied the most important position
in the total volume of self-supporting production. It would have been impossible,
if during these years the army had not for the most part provided its own
means of livelihood and running costs and instead had relied on the government.
Responding to the Party Central and Northwest Bureau's call for 'production
self-sufficiency', the army has fulfilled its production tasks in the midst
of the urgent work of fighting, guarding and training. The objective
circumstances of some troop units are better than those of others; some have
more duties than others, some have worked harder than others. As a result
their respective level of achievement has varied. Nevertheless, in general
they have all fulfilled their tasks. With very little capital and backward
techniques, they have all developed agriculture, handicrafts, transport and
commerce. Some have even set up relatively large-scale textile and papermaking
factories. During these two years, the capital invested by the government
in the army's productive undertakings has not exceeded 6-7 million
<B><I>yuan</I> </B>in total. However, in that time they have both ensured
supplies worth over 300 million <B><I>yuan</I> </B>and they have accumulated
roughly 80 million <B><I>yuan</I> </B>capital from their agriculture, industry
and commerce. They have opened up several tens of thousands of
<B><I>mu</I></B> of land, and supplied rich experience for the whole of
production construction. They have not only played a political and military
role in the protection of the Border Region but have also played a role in
directly providing a large amount of financial supplies and in helping to
develop the Border Region economy.
<P>
Let us take a look at the self-supporting production of a certain company
in a certain regiment. The income and expenditure of this company during
1941 are shown in Table 8.1.
<P>
With the exception of 750 <B><I>yuan</I> </B>production capital from upper
levels, miscellaneous payments of 360 <B><I>yuan</I> </B>from the office,
supplementary production payments of 2,855 <B><I>yuan</I> </B>and supplementary
provisions payments of 3,771 <B><I>yuan</I> </B>given by the regimental supplies
office, a total of 7,736 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, the expenditure of 52,530
<B><I>yuan</I> </B>shown [Table 8.1] was met by the company's own production
of 44,794 <B><I>yuan</I>. </B>This excludes the capital accumulated for use
in production the following year.
<P>
According to these figures, each regiment of ten companies can be self-supporting
up to 440,440 <B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
Furthermore, there is still the self-supporting production run by the regimental
headquarters [shown in Table 8.2]. The total Value of production of the
companies, battalions and regiments is 703,828 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. The regiment's
total annual expenditure (including grain and a proportion of clothing and
bedding) is 896,638 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, which leaves a shortfall of 185,510
<B><I>yuan</I></B> to be supplemented from upper levels. As a result the
regiment's own self-supporting production accounts for 79 per cent of consumption
and supplements from above account for 21 per cent. If we add the large amount
of self-supporting production carried out by the brigade headquarters, the
proportion for the whole brigade far exceeds 80 per cent.
<P>
The following material is a summary by the Garrison Office of five years'
production by the garrison army. We can see the general situation in
self-supporting production by the army.

<B>A SUMMARY OF FIVE YEARS PRODUCTION BY THE GARRISON ARMY</B>

<I>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp; Outline</I>
<P>
<P>
In the new and difficult environment since the War of Resistance and following
Chairman Mao's call for production, the garrison army began the production
movement in the autumn of 1938. At the time, production was not yet aimed
at self-sufficiency and was merely making up for deficiencies in the necessities
of life. We could only give each member of the force 0.05
<B><I>yuan</I></B> for vegetables and 1.5 <B><I>jin</I></B> of grain per
day. At the market-prices of the time each <B><I>yuan</I></B> could buy 30-40
<B><I>jin</I></B> of vegetables, 2 <B><I>jin</I></B> of edible oil, or 100
<B><I>jin</I></B> of fire wood. With a hundred men in a company, each day
they had 5 <B><I>yuan</I></B> for vegetables. If they bought vegetables,
they could not buy oil, salt and firewood. If they bought oil, salt and firewood,
they could not buy vegetables. Pork was even further beyond their reach.
As for their clothing and bedding, you could rarely see a soldier whose clothing
was not darned and patched. Bullet bags were so tattered they could not longer
carry bullets, which had to be put in pouches. Some wore padded clothes in
summer and some wore shorts in winter. Some went on parade barefoot in the
snow and some could not even find a broken old leather bag for leg wrappings.
These were the material conditions of the troops then.
<P>
The methods used in the production movement at that time were: (i) to set
up cooperatives; (ii) to plant lots of vegetables; (iii) to set up
grinding-mills, to raise pigs and sheep, to make bean curd and to grow bean
sprouts; (iv) to mobilize every soldier to learn to make shoes; (v) to knit
woollen clothes, socks, shoes and gloves; (vi) to promote economy and prevent
waste. The result of half a year's production in 1938 exceeded the plan,
and the soldiers' life was greatly improved. For example, they ensured
self-sufficiency in vegetables, each week they had two pork meals, they partly
met requirements for woollen clothes, socks, gloves and shoes, and they
supplemented the supply of bullet bags, pouches, leather bags and leg wrappings.
<P>
The Significant achievements in production of the latter half of 1938 raised
the troops' enthusiasm for, and trust in, production. So in 1939 even greater
tasks for self-supporting production could be put forward, reducing the burden
on the people of the Border Region. In 1939 it was stipulated that the troops
in their agricultural work should plant grain as well as vegetables so as
to fulfil the task of producing 4,700 <B><I>tan </I></B>of grain. Most production
in 1939 was agricultural and 25,136 <B><I>mu </I></B>of new land was opened
up over the whole year. At first it was estimated that 2
<B><I>tou</I></B> of hulled grain could be harvested per <B><I>mu
</I></B>giving a total of 4,986 <B><I>tan</I></B>. But because the new land
was just being broken in, there were not enough agricultural tools, leadership
experience was not even and some of the land suffered natural disasters,
only 2,590 <B><I>tan </I></B>of hulled grain was harvested. At this time
the troops still had little capital and commerce had not yet developed.
<P>
In 1940 the production tasks for the troops stipulated that each section
should provide grain for one-and-a-half months, a total of 3,400
<B><I>tan</I></B>. In that year the troops opened up 20,679.7 <B><I>mu
</I></B>of land which should have given 4,136 <B><I>tan</I></B> of hulled
grain. Because the harvest was poor, they only got 2,400
<B><I>tan</I></B>. In order to fulfil its duties, each section also took-on
salt transport, digging liquorice root and felling trees (in Guanzhong they
also did some commercial work). The garrison army earned a total profit of
2,236,516.16 <B><I>yuan</I></B> from this supplementary production. This,
together with the agricultural harvest, provided grain for one-and-a-half
months and also met part of the supplements for equipment.
<P>
In 1941 the operating budget for all troops was 4,479,536.40
<B><I>yuan</I></B> and the task for production was to provide 400,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. However, the result was entirely different. The requirement
for operating expenses was much greater and the task for self-supporting
production was much greater than originally estimated. Chiefly as a result
of the call by Commander Zhu to select six battalions to get salt, we got
a total of 56,966 packs of salt valued at 236,408.90 <B><I>yuan</I></B>.
In agriculture 14,794.6 <B><I>mu</I></B> were opened up and 1,170
<B><I>tan</I></B> of miscellaneous grains harvested. In commerce the total
profit was 12,019,592.72 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Because of price inflation,
the value of paper money fell. Regular expenses and clothing and bedding
expenses for the whole year were 7,881,757.17 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. (All these
excludes the income and expenditure of one regiment and the forces in Guanzhong.)
The average daily expenses for provisions per man over the whole year was
0.50 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Apart from the 0.10 <B><I>yuan</I></B> issued by
the State, we provided 0.40 <B><I>yuan</I></B> ourselves, a total of 2,592,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The total for the above regular expenses, bedding and
clothing expenses and provisions expenses was 10,473,757.17
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, 5,673,804.53 <B><I>yuan</I></B> above the original budget.
There was still a surplus after payments were made from production income.
<P>
In 1942 the budget for expenses (excluding grain, clothing and bedding) was
5,833,636 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and we took on the task of helping central expenses
with 2,500,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. The year's production plan was for 12,400,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. By August (statistics for the later period not yet
available), commerce had earned a profit of 38,969,230,20
<B><I>yuan</I></B> and industry had a profit of 431,773.40
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, giving a total of 39,401,004.60 <B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
By June we had received 1,440,058.60 <B><I>yuan</I></B> running expenses,
and supplementary expenses for the first issue of summer clothing of 206,825
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. Actual expenditure was running expenses 7,750,598.85
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, supplements for bedding and clothing 3,067,730.60
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, and supplements for provisions (the State issued 0.70
<B><I>yuan</I></B> per man per day and the actual cost was 3.00
<B><I>yuan</I></B>) over the half-year, 9,180,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Most
of the winter clothing and bedding for the latter half of the year was provided
by the brigades and regiments themselves. The second issue of summer clothing,
half of the padded cloth, 40 per cent of the bedding, and bindings, bullet
bags, grenade pouches, padded cotton shoes, and light shoes, these eight
items had a total value of 12,641,200 <B><I>yuan.</I></B> Other things like
charcoal for heating in winter were provided by each unit itself. As for
animal fodder, in 1941 we provided two months' horse-feed ourselves. In 1942
the Finance Department issued eight months' hay for horses, leaving two months'
unaccounted for. In general we cut two months' supply of grass ourselves,
saving roughly 1,200,000 <B><I>yuan.</I></B> Furthermore, in 1942 the budget
for horse fodder was 11,000 <B><I>tan</I></B>. According to the regulations
of the Finance Department 1 <B><I>tou</I></B> of hulled grain is equivalent
to 2 <B><I>tou</I></B> of horse fodder. But this is insufficient and it is
necessary to increase the annual amount by 2,750 <B><I>tan</I></B> which
comes to 1,375,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> at 500 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per
<B><I>tan</I></B>.
<P>
The outcome of five years' production has been that, besides meeting annual
running expenses, clothing and bedding expenses and provisions expenses,
current financial assets include 24 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> commercial
capital 556 transport animals (excluding plough oxen, and excluding the First
and Fifth regiments) with a value of 11,232,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, and factory
capital of 712,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. The combined total is 35,944,00
<B><I>yuan</I></B>.

(Note: The above summary does not include 359 Brigade and the peace preservation
corps<I>, <B>[bao'an budui].</B>)</I>
<P>
<I>(b) Lessons</I>
<P>
(1) The reason why the forces of the Border Region have been able to carry
out self-supporting production and solve great problems over the past few
years is their immense labour power and better organizational strength, and
the fact that the Border Region also has rich resources to develop. This
experience proves that the troops can be entirely self-sufficient. Because
the troops have solved the problem of self-sufficiency over the past few
years and increased their faith in production, they have realized that
self-sufficiency is one of the major tasks in building-up the army, and is
one of the best methods overcoming hardships and coming through a difficult
period.
<P>
(2) The production construction of the troops is part of the economic
construction of the whole Border Region. Although in the past the troops
did well in working hard to fulfill production tasks, ideologically they
did not emphasize the relationship with the construction of the Border Region.
Therefore they still had a shallow understanding of the development of the
agricultural and industrial base. They were not good enough at working hard
to establish a secure foundation. Their thinking on unified construction
was also muddled. There was even a lack of coordination between units and
incidences of serious breaches of command discipline. These shortcomings
must be resolutely and ruthlessly corrected.
<P>
(3) Under conditions of backward production methods, the production base
must chiefly be built us depending on the labour power and economic base
of each unit. Therefore the government's financial and economic policy should
look after the productive undertakings of these units. Within the confines
of the government's unified policy, they should be allowed full development
and profitability. Only this way can the development of productive undertakings
have greater organization, greater strength, greater unity, greater rationality,
and greater ability to fight the blockade in a unified way. The greatest
shortcoming of the troops in production is to pay most attention to commerce
and to neglect agriculture. In future they must improve and encourage
agricultural production.
<P>
(4) In their productive work, the troops should grasp ideological leadership
tightly and set up and strengthen the regulations and leadership organs in
production. They should correct and guard against cadres doing things without
coordination, becoming decadent, eating and living well, spending recklessly,
not economizing, not stressing effective results and adopting other corrupt
practices.
<P>
The above sums up our opinions.
<P>
The self-supporting production of 359 Brigade is the best among the various
units in the garrison forces. In the first place the leading comrades of
359 Brigade have grasped the strategy of agriculture first, industry and
transport second, and commerce third. They have taken advantage of their
lack of active duties, the suitable environment of Nanniwan for agriculture
and of The Suide special military area for light industry. They have mobilized
the large amount of labour power and within three years have completed large
assignments for economic self-sufficiency. In particular they have grasped
the policy of taking agriculture as the core so that the economic base rests
on a secure foundation. Second, the troops of 359 Brigade have carried out
the following concrete economic construction: (i) Their grain production
in 1940 was a failure, but they were not disheartened. They persevered in
1941 and got tremendous results. In 1942 they strengthened this foundation.
They opened up 25,000 <B><I>mu</I></B> of land and planted grain, vegetables,
hemp and tobacco, meeting the troops requirements of vegetables, lamp-oil,
hemp for shoes and tobacco, and supplementing supplies of grain, vegetable-oil,
horse beans and fodder. Thus after only two years' work they laid the foundation
of the agricultural economy of all the companies in the brigade. Further
more, the period of labour for all the officers and men was no more than
two months per year. Ten months were left for troop exercises, and training
was not impeded. According to the new method thought out by the brigade,
each company sets up a specialist agricultural labour group of six or seven
men and the masses of soldiers only provide extensive assistance during the
busy agricultural seasons. In this way training time is even greater. (ii)
They have used the farms to develop animal husbandry. In 1942 the whole brigade
maintained 2,000 pigs which met the troops' requirements for meat and oil.
Since the troops ate more meat, they saved grain. In addition they organized
groups of men to gather firewood, make charcoal and saw planks, which not
only provided for their own fuel and building needs but also provided a surplus
for sale. (iii) They also built up industry and handicrafts. In 1941 they
assigned some soldiers and rear-service personnel to establish the Daguang
Textile Mill and Daguang Soap Factory. Now there are 'Daguang' products on
the market in addition to those they consume themselves. They set up ten
salt-wells in Suide and Nanniwan, one charcoal-pit, two carpentry factories,
three iron-factories, six mills, eight flour-mills and one oil-press. They
also mobilized the soldiers during their spare time after training to spin
woollen thread, to make various kinds of utensils from willow and elm wands,
to make writing-boards from birch bark, to make vegetable-boxes and to make
lamplighters. This work done by the soldiers not only benefited the whole
but also profited the individuals. The brigade stipulated that four-fifths
of all the products of handicraft labour done using publicly-owned tools
should come under public ownership and one-fifth should belong to the private
individual, and the two-thirds of that produced not using publicly-owned
tools should come under public ownership and one-third should belong to the
private individuals. This method provided commodities for public use and
was also equivalent to raising the soldiers' pay. (iv) They established a
strong transport undertaking. Now they have a transport team which owns 600
pack mules and is fully engaged in the transport of salt and goods. Along
the road between Suide, Sanbian and Yan'an they have set up ten stables and
settled a group of older and weaker personnel. (v) Their commercial organ
is the Daguang Store, which has ten branches besides the main shop. The profit
in the first nine months of 1942 was over 6 million <B><I>yuan</I></B>. However,
this commerce only makes up 10 per cent of the brigade's total production
of 60 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> (at Yan'an market-prices). (vi) The brigade
has implemented a unified production plan, and regulations for production
and supply. The production plan for the whole brigade is fixed by the brigade
headquarters. Some undertakings are directly run by the brigade headquarters
such as large-scale industry, transport and commerce. Others are run by the
regiments and companies such as agriculture, animal husbandry, small industry
and commerce. Inspections are carried out at each level from brigade down
to individual companies. The regulations for production are also fixed by
the brigade headquarters. The arrangements for soldiers spinning woollen
thread described above is an example of this. The regulations for supply
also preserve unity. Although the agricultural, industrial transport and
commercial undertakings are each run separately, all expenditure above a
certain level must be approved from above. Lower levels cannot spend freely.
This prevents instance where free spending of the fruits of production bring
unequal blessings or waste. It ensures the utility of the whole brigade.
(vii) They have not only developed large amounts of production but have also
carried out the policy of strict economy rigorously. For example, they laid
down that they would issue three suits of summer clothing every two years
and two suits of padded clothing every three years, and that new bedding
and clothing would only be issued in exchange for old. They also issued needles
and thread to the soldiers so that they could repair clothes themselves.
Thereafter bedding and clothing lasted longer, and the soldiers took greater
care of them, greatly reducing these expenses. As mentioned above, they ordered
the soldiers to make writing-boards from birch bark, vegetable-boxes and
lamplighters, and issued wool to the soldiers to knit socks, gloves and so
forth. This not only increased the supply of daily necessities but also
economized on purchases of these things. All building construction and tool
repairs for the whole brigade is done by the troops and none is contracted
out. All these things have not only economized on expenditure but have also
developed care for public property among the officers and men, attention
to results, opposition to waste and a simple style of work that rejects
ostentation.
<P>
The following material is a summary of three years' production by 359 Brigade,
drawn-up by its leading comrade. It shows us the actual situation in the
brigade's agriculture, industry and commerce.

<B>A SUMMARY OF PRODUCTION AND CONSTRUCTION IN 359 BRIGADE OVER THE PAST
THREE YEARS</B>
<P>
In the three years since this brigade has returned to take up the defence
of the Border Region, the implementation of the economic policy of self-reliance
and self-sufficiency has been a new creation in building up the army. With
the exception of grain received from the government, we have achieved 82
per cent self-sufficiency in all other expenses through carrying out this
policy. In this way we overcame difficulties with material resources, improved
our troops' provisions, consolidated our forces, promoted the physical strength
of the soldiers, consolidated army discipline and strengthened the ties between
the army and the people. The following outlines our experience over the past
three years in agricultural, industrial and commercial operations.

<I>(A) Agriculture</I>
<P>
In response to the call for a production movement, we began agricultural
production in 1940. We planned to plough and plant enough land to be
self-sufficient for two months' grain, to be entirely self-sufficient in
vegetables from the summer onwards, and to raise enough pigs to cover our
meat requirement for the New Year festivities. However, since the areas where
we were stationed in Suide, Mizhi and Wuqi counties were heavily populated
with little spare land, we had to travel to places over 100
<B><I>li</I></B> away (Jiulishan and Qingjian) to open up new land and wasted
a lot of time in travel. Although enthusiastic and taking trouble, we did
not investigate carefully nor plan suitably. As a result the harvest did
not match the capital spent on tools and seeds. However, the vegetables planted
near where we were stationed enabled us to be self-sufficient for these after
the summer Each provisions unit was issued 0.10 <B><I>yuan</I></B> provisions
expenses per man per day, barely enough to buy oil and salt. The troops had
to go up to 100 <B><I>li</I></B> away carrying charcoal for sale. They earned
enough to make more charcoal and a surplus to buy pigs for raising. These
productive activities laid the foundations for the companies to improve
provisions. Apart from opening up all the public unused land (public cemeteries,
the neighbourhood of temples, odd pieces of land near cities, stretches of
old unused road, old military defence works, etc. ) around the towns of Suide,
Mizhi, Jiaxian, Wuqi and Qingjian where we were stationed and along the river
defences, we also rented land from the local inhabitants to plant vegetables.
The spirit of bitter struggle and hard work of the commanders and troops
gained great sympathy and understanding from people of all walks of life.
Some of the landlords from whom we rented land (like the landlords and rich
peasants of Yihezhen) would not accept our rent payments. Other poor peasants
voluntarily granted temporary tenant rights. This came from the deep sympathy
and concern of the people for the army. For those stationed in poor agricultural
regions, particularly those where the climate only suited summer and autumn
crops, agricultural production was not only necessary to solve difficulties
in running expenses, but was also essential to maintain the correct relationship
with the people. From the end of 1939 to the spring of 1940, the troops did
not have enough expenses for provisions and were short of vegetables. Personnel
sent out to buy sometimes resorted to the serious actions of forced purchase
or purchase at unfair prices. In carrying out agricultural production, we
ensured a good political influence among the people with the exception of
the small number of people in the county towns who relied on market gardening
for their livelihood and spoke angrily of the poor defence forces who offered
no profit.
<P>
We solved the following problems with our production in 1940: (i) We became
self-sufficient in vegetables after May. (ii) We added pig-raising to
self-sufficiency in vegetables and improved provisions in the latter half
of the year so that each man could eat 1 <B><I>jin</I></B> of meat per month.
(iii) Each provisions unit made their own agricultural implements and raised
over ten pigs. (iv) We proved the old saying: 'If you have vegetables you
have half a year's grain, if you have no vegetables you have half a year's
famine.' The troops' grain was sufficient. (v) Planting grain meant opening
up new land. In the first year we got no profit from grain since it was too
far from the places we were stationed. We could not weed at the right time
and we wasted too much effort in travel. For these reasons, the planned grain
harvest was not realized.
<P>
In 1941 the troops found land they could farm and implemented the policy
of farming which the commander-in-chief himself ordered. Each man on average
farmed 6 <B><I>mu</I></B> of land. Each <B><I>mu</I></B> needed seven days'
work including opening up, planting seed, weeding and harvesting. Six
<B><I>mu</I></B> required forty-two days' from which was obtained roughly
3 <B><I>tou</I></B> (lower-middle harvest) of hulled millet, and hay, also
worth 3 <B><I>tou</I></B> hulled grain. The grain and hay together could
be exchanged for one suit of padded clothing. If an upper-middle harvest
could be obtained, the return would increase by one-quarter. Various secondary
crops such as corn, hemp and sesame also gave a harvest the same as that
of millet. Around the edges of the 6 <B><I>mu</I></B> we could plant many
subsidiary crops such as castor, pumpkins, beans and so forth giving good
harvest. In addition, each man planted half a <B><I>mu</I></B> to provide
vegetables for a whole year. Also among the products were hot peppers, garlic,
onions, lamp-oil, tobacco, grass rope for sandals, and so forth. Since we
had field crops, it was easy to raise domestic animals such as pigs, cows,
sheep, chickens, ducks, rabbits etc. As pig-raising was most profitable,
it was the major subsidiary. Reckoning at one pig for every five men, a hundred
men could raise twenty pigs. As well as this they could raise three sows.
Every year each sow can have two litters of at the very least four piglets.
With no swine fever and no untoward events, they could produce twenty-four
pigs per year. Killing pigs at a rate of two a month, we would have to kill
twenty-four a year. The pig-breeding rate would counterbalance the slaughter
rate and there would still be surplus piglets. From birth to slaughter,
piglets-can grow 5 <B><I>liang</I></B> per day on average. In actual practice
the annual average was indeed one pig per five men.
<P>
As a result of agricultural production, there was a lot of vegetable refuse.
Since we were grinding flour, we got the chaff remains from the husking,
and since we were making beancurd we got the bean residues, etc. We could
raise the pigs using waste and gain great benefits. Now the entire brigade
has achieved all of the above. The wealth obtained from agriculture and animal
husbandry by each provisions unit is increasing. And this wealth is controlled
by the party branch, supervised by all the soldiers and used rationally according
to the regulations laid down at high levels. As yet there is no summary for
1942, but harvests will definitely be no less than last year.
<P>
Reviewing the agricultural production movement, we can make the following
summary of its merits and shortcomings.
<P>
<B><I>Merits</I></B>
<P>
(1) The troops carried out political mobilization concerning the performance
of the tasks so that all personnel realized that the slogan of self-sufficiency
in production put forward by Chairman Mao was of great significance in
maintaining unity in the War of Resistance and in passing through an economic
crisis. The commander-in-chief himself led the way after his return to the
Border Region and strengthened the soldiers' enthusiasm and endurance.
<P>
(2) Improvements in real livelihood made us feel the advantages of the production
movement.
<P>
(3) The brigade and regiments fixed the whole of the annual -production plan,
stipulated the production tasks for the companies, and conscientiously supervised
the regiments' guidance and supervision of the companies' production.
<P>
(4) The companies organized production committees to discuss and arrange
the implementation of production tasks, to inspect and examine the economy
(the companies' economies are entirely public) and to ensure the implementation
of the supply regulations.
<P>
(5) Mow every company is enjoying a self-sufficient, rich peasant family
standard of living because of its agricultural production.
<P>
<B><I>Shortcomings</I></B>
<P>
(1) We have not paid full attention to production tools, we have not organized
and employed plough oxen and we have not selected some soldiers (from among
the cooks) to specialize in farming throughout the year. We have generally
adopted the method of all-round mobilization, wasting time and impeding
troop-training.
<P>
(2) Some cadres have taken a negative attitude towards farming and do not
strive to get a larger harvest by extending the land farmed.
<P>
(3) We have not been conscientious in gathering manure.
<P>
(4) We have no cadres specially directing production.
<P>
According to experience, we must use oxen for ploughing, carting manure and
harvesting (using ox-carts), prepare sufficient tools, assign cadres with
special responsibility for directing production (a deputy battalion leader
for production and company leaders with special duties), assign soldiers
(from among the cooks) to carry out agricultural production throughout the
year, mobilize all the officers and men to take part at planting, weeding
and harvesting times, and stipulate the number of workdays so as to use a
fixed amount of time. In this way the total work per man to farm 6
<B><I>mu</I></B> and cut a year's fire wood will not exceed two months, and
we shall not only get grain but will also become entirely self-sufficient
for all daily vegetables, meat, straw shoes, firewood, shoes and socks. The
last few items alone make up one-third of all running expenses so they cannot
he considered a small problem. The grain harvest can sustain 2,000 men.
<P>
The above is a brief summary of the brigade's agricultural production.
<P>
The following list shows how much work and time it would cost a provisions
unit for a hundred men to travel over 60 <B><I>li</I></B> to make its purchases
if it did not plant vegetables itself.

</TABLE>
<P>
<P>
Using this table alone we can explode the lie that 'agricultural production
is profitless and hinders training' .
<P>
<B><I>(B) Industry</I></B>
<P>
There follows a summary of our experience in establishing and developing
the Daguang Textile Mill and of other handicrafts.
<P>
(1) Motivation and intentions.
<P>
The troops need clothing and bedding every year. The raw materials for bedding
and clothing are the chief problems in supply work. In the winter of 1939
after the troops returned to the defence of the Border Region, we had
difficulties in buying these raw materials and also had no money. In response
to the call by Chairman Mao for self-reliance, self-sufficiency and overcoming
difficulties to build up the Border Region, we made a long-term plan to run
a textile mill.
<P>
(2) Trial beginnings.
<P>
We began to think of running a textile mill in September 1940. At the time
there was a man from Hebei in the short-term training class set up by the
supply department who could weave cloth. We set up a small wooden loom, bought
some foreign yarn and tried it out. Within ten days all the yarn was woven
and the cloth was quite good. We could weave 100 feet per day [Chinese
measurement] and costs worked out one-third cheaper than buying cloth.
<P>
Since there were weavers among the troops we decided to set up a factory
and undertook the following: (i) we bought wood and built nineteen small
looms in our own machine-repair shop, and we bought four metal looms from
Shanxi; (ii) we bought yarn from local merchants on credit; (iii) we selected
twenty skilled men from places like Gaoyang in Hebei who were among the troops.
<P>
In this way the factory got going. It was not only profitable and convenient,
but also solved problems in buying cloth.
<P>
In December 1940 we decided to enlarge the factory in order to achieve
self-sufficiency in cloth for the whole brigade.
<P>
Early in 1941 we abolished service personnel at all levels throughout the
brigade, and collected together over a hundred youths as apprentices to study
weaving.
<P>
We again bought two iron looms from the northwest of Shanxi and made a further
eleven large wooden ones ourselves. In February and March we made another
sixteen large wooden looms, and fourteen more towards the end of March. We
thus had sixty-six looms of all kinds. At the same time we made spinning-wheels
and other essential small implements.
<P>
As regards raw materials, in 1941 the government issued the brigade with
400,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> capital for production. Of this, 250,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> was divided among the regiments. Of the remaining 150,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, 100,000 was spent buying 300 bales of yarn (each bale
was 7 <B><I>jin</I></B> 14 <B><I>liang</I></B> and cost 280-90
<B><I>yuan)</I></B> and some things that had to be bought (such as the wire
for the looms which we could not make ourselves and had to purchase outside).
<P>
Administered by the supply department accountants, the workers divided into
yarn-starchers, weavers, thread-joiners [<B><I>luoxian</I></B>], and threaders
[<B><I>daxian</I></B>]. Each group had twenty to thirty men. About ten skilled
men became master workmen and took charge of the technical work in starching
and reeling the yarn. Intelligent youths studied weaving, and the less bright
and the younger did threading and thread-pining.
<P>
As soon as the looms started working, we became aware of a need for more
labour power. So taking the name, the Daguang Textile Mills, we employed
fifty young boys and girls from the Suide areas as apprentices. We also took
captured bandits and people who had committed mistakes from the military
courts. In this way we assembled our labour force. There were then over 200
workers administered by the military training unit and the supply department.
They were divided into four platoons and twelve squads (including one women's
platoon; each platoon had three squads of ten or more people).
<P>
The factory was roughly taking shape. But there were still two difficult
problems to be solved, first the supply of capital and raw materials, and
second the control, education and training of the workers.
<P>
(a) The problem of the supply of capital and raw materials <BR>
In May 1941 we borrowed 200,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> from the Border Region
Bank but it still did not provide support for long. After that we had to
make friends, built up relationships, liaison with rich merchants and buy
raw materials on credit, making repayments at fixed periods.
<P>
Before May 1941 most foreign yarn was bought from Shanxi. Afterwards, because
supplies were cut off, we could only buy from Sian and Yan'an (Shenxin and
Guanghe brands). We also bought raw cotton from Sian and Yan'an.
<P>
The supply of local yarn came as a result of the government's encouragement
of local women to spin. At first the wage for spinning 1
<B><I>jin</I></B> of yarn was from 3 to 7 <B><I>yuan</I></B> (raw cotton
cost 4 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per <B><I>jin</I></B> ), and it was divided into
three grades. In July and August this was clanged to issuing 11/2
<B><I>jin</I></B> of prepared Cotton in return for 1 <B><I>jin</I></B> of
yarn. In February and March of 1942 this was again changed into 2
<B><I>jin</I></B> or 2 <B><I>jin</I></B> 2 <B><I>liang</I></B> for 1
<B><I>jin</I></B> of yarn.
<P>
Because the supply of yarn from the people was insufficient and of poor quality,
we set up our own yarn-spinning factory with four cotton-bowing machines
and forty spearing machines in October 1941. By July 1942 we still lacked
skilled workers and the cotton bowed by the machines could not all be used
on the machines (the raw cotton was poor). Now only the four bowing machines
are still going and spinning has stopped.
<P>
(b) The problem of controlling, educating and staining the workers. <BR>
The number of workers has increased but there are many different elements
and they are not easy to control. They young service personify in particular
were used to a free life and had not taken part in labour before they left
home. At first they would fight, curse and carry on every day. They would
say 'We've seen all the grocers, big and small' and would not accept any
controls.
<P>
Most of the women from the villages had come because of marriage problems.
They had been sent to the factory by the women's aid committee of the government.
Whenever they talked of marriage, some cried and some laughed. They often
asked for help in solving their marriage problems.
<P>
Persuading captured bandits to work was difficult.
<P>
Many of the people being punished for mistakes were company and platoon cadres
who maintained their old character, were unwilling to work and were
troublemakers.
<P>
From January to March 1941, the head of the supply department tried hard
to correct them and achieved some success.
<P>
During this time, approximately twenty skilled workers acted as master-workers
and taught the youths in the weaving group. First they used the small looms
(needed little strength and easy to manage). The master-worker did all the
preliminaries and told them how to start the loom, how to connect broken
threads, how to handle the shuttle, and how to coordinate hand and foot.
At the beginning they only wove for two or three hours a day. After one or
two months, this group had mastered these looms and moved onto the large
wooden ones, and another group came to learn. Thus group-by-group the teaching
went on until March 1941.
<P>
The work of joining the threads and threading was easy to learn and only
needed patience. Once you had learned to join the threads properly, you were
all right. But it needed practice. When unpracticed, the results were not
good enough for weaving.
<P>
When the work began and the young apprentices sat at the looms or did their
joining and threading, their backsides ached after a short time, yarn easily
broke, tempers rose, there was little patience and they wasted a lot of thread
and broke some looms. So before March 1941, products were no good.
<P>
Apart from strengthening technical training and raising technical skills,
the chief way of dealing with this was political encouragement and education
in revolutionary labour discipline. This made the workers consciously realize
the important significance of production, made them patient in their work
and improved their enthusiasm for production and their labour discipline.
<P>
Various methods of education were used to implement military discipline.
The head of the supply department, He Weizhong, the head of the military
training unit and the branch Party secretary personally came to give guidance
every day, explaining that production at the rear was equal to fighting at
the front, that they should accept organization, that work was glorious and
that they were the working class. We proposed a competition with emulation
between apprentices and emulation between male and female workers. We implemented
a system of rewards and punishments and a system for getting time off. At
the same time each person was given some writing materials every month, and
we bought some entertainment equipment.
<P>
Thereafter the workers felt that to work was glorious. After work they wanted
to study culture and politics and to live a military life. As a result life
became organized on military lines. In this way we gradually set up the
soldier-worker system, and the factory got going in the right way. Before
breakfast there were early-morning exercises and running. After breakfast
they went to work. In winter and spring there was a ten-hour day.
<P>
We then encountered new difficulties.
<P>
The factory site was a hired house. As it was not convenient for work, we
built ten or so cave houses ourselves for the workers to live in. Unexpectedly
the cave houses were moist and damp, the workers developed sores and many
of them could not work. So we changed the new caves into storerooms and the
workers moved into the hired house. In June we began to build five stone
cave houses for the looms and these were not completed until October. During
this period there was nowhere to put the looms. The only thing we could do
was to put them in the courtyards and work under tents. In May and June there
was early morning dew and it rained often. Wet thread is no good for weaving.
In July the weather was hot and the sun strong. The threads became very dry
which was also no good for weaving. The only thing we could do then was cover
the looms in wet army blankets and pour water on the ground. But this only
worked for two or three hours and, as can be imagined, gave a lot of trouble.
<P>
The months from June to September passed in this way. The new caves were
completed in October and we also built one-story houses with a total of
twenty-seven rooms for the workers to live in. Only then were all these problems
overcome.
<P>
As for raising the workers' technical level, after June the youths gradually
became skilled, and some even exceeded the master-workers.
<P>
In the first week when they were apprentices they generally only worked for
two or three hours a day and made four or five feet of cloth. Alter two or
three weeks they worked for seven or eight hours a day and could weave 10
to 40 feet. After April they could do 40 to 50 feet, and by May, 60 to 70.
After June, they had all become skilled workers and the best could weave
120 to 130 feet a day. During this time the quality of cloth continuously
improved.
<P>
We can say that after June 1941 the factory was consolidated and began to
develop, having overcome all kinds of difficulties.
<P>
(3) Establishing the soldier-worker system
<P>
The factory expanded and needed to be regularized. It was very inconvenient
for the administrators from the military training unit. And so under the
supply department we set up a factory head and a commissar to provide leadership,
and drew-up a draft outline for the administration of the factory.
<P>
Under the leadership of the head and commissar, the administration was divided
into four sections: labour, operations, accounts and general work. These
sections divided the tasks and worked together, each with its own responsibility.
We stipulated a variety of regulations for meetings, minutes, reports,
inspection, livelihood, pay (according to technical skill with the top rate
of 10 <B><I>yuan</I></B>)and for rewards and punishment. We settled the times
for work, study, rest and relaxation. We fixed the scope for democratic life
and all kinds of principles for the workshops, dormitories, canteen, days
off, leaving the premises and so forth.
<P>
By October 1941, everything was properly set up.
<P>
After October we felt that the wooden looms were not as good as the iron
ones. The cloth the latter produced was of good quality and needed less work.
We planned gradually to replace the wooden looms with iron ones. Between
January and October 1942 we built iron looms ourselves. However, as one had
to be strong and skilful to weave with these looms and there were not enough
workers like that, we could not convert entirely to iron looms and we did
not build any more. The total was forty-five iron looms and sixty-two wooden
looms. Apart from this, we bought thirteen wooden looms for weaving woollen
blankets and woollen goods from the Longwan Factory (in spring 1942) and
built thirteen wooden looms ourselves. This gave a total of 133 looms. On
average we produced about 1,000 bolts of wide cloth, 500 woollen towels and
100 blankets per month.
<P>
After May 1942 the pay system was changed into a piecework system giving
.70-80 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per month at the most ( roughly one-tenth of wages
in a privately-run factory), and 20-30 <B><I>yuan</I></B> at the least. This
increased the workers' enthusiasm to produce. Same workers did not take their
noon rest and did not stop work at the end of the working day but kept an
working. After some persuasion and education, we overcame this excessive
enthusiasm.
<P>
We persisted in the soldier-worker system. The factory workers also grew
vegetables and raised pigs for their food.
<P>
In the winter of 1942 we stopped work for one month to make padded clothing.
<P>
In 1941 after all expenses, the factory made a profit of 3,900,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. In the first ten months of 1942, the profit was 8 million
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The value of the factory site, looms, yarn and raw cotton
is 5 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> ( yarn and cotton 1 minion
<B><I>yuan</I></B>). We intend to invest several million more to maintain
reproduction.
<P>
In sum the lessons of experience in running industry are as follows:
<P>
(i) The profit earned by the soldier-workers working in textiles, that is
the Daguang Hill led by the brigade supply department, is the largest of
all the profits earned by the various industrial enterprises. In 1941 the
total number of employees was 250 and in 1942 it were 225. After all expenses,
its profit in 1941 was 3,900,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> equivalent to the price
of 4,000 <B><I>tan </I></B>of millet at year-end price (300<B><I> jin
</I></B>per <B><I>tan</I></B>).
<P>
Profit by October 1942 was 8 million <B><I>yuan</I></B>, again equivalent
to 4,000 <B><I>tan</I></B> of millet at current prices in Suide. The average
net profit per worker was roughly 18 <B><I>tan</I></B>.
<P>
In the light of two years' experience and the present circumstances, we shall
invest 25,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per head for the 225 employees of the factory
during 1943, not counting buildings and tools, making a total of 5,625,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. The cloth required for uniforms will be bought from the
factory. In this way production for 1943 will earn a net profit per man of
20 <B><I>tan</I></B> of millet (because of inflation, it is best to take
millet as the standard ) .
<P>
Each regiment has a cloth-weaving factory which can produce enough cloth
for a hundred men.
<P>
In addition, apart from undertakings purely for producing equipment and clothing
for the troops such as shoemaking, cloths-making and leather-tanning, the
brigade also has roughly 200 blacksmiths and carpenters. In the light of
the past two to three years' experience and the prospects for the continued
development of the Border Region economy, these craftsmen could make an annual
profit roughly equivalent to 6 <B><I>tan</I></B> of millet in return for
an investment of 1,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per man.
<P>
There is also a papermaking factory and an oil-pressing shop which use as
raw materials the sesame seeds and straw coming from the troops' agriculture
and <B><I>malan</I></B> grass cut by the soldier-workers, for which the factories
pay a cheap price. These enterprise employ sixty people with an average net
profit per head of 6 <B><I>tan</I></B> of millet.
<P>
(ii) Besides agriculture, effective operation of the system of soldier-workers
is a way of realizing self-sufficiency and solve both commodity and financial
problems. Commerce is definitely not as reliable as agriculture and industry.
Commerce relies on others, not on oneself, so it is not suitable to do too
much of it.
<P>
(iii) Shortcomings are: in running a large factory there is a lot of expenses
and waste, and there is no fixed amount of capital. This influences reproduction.
Therefore in future we must strive to set up a fixed amount of capital.
<P>
(iv) In the past we did not take the whole Border Region economy into
consideration. Nor did we make a unified plan for the troops' agricultural
and industrial production. We could not interlock agriculture, industry,
transport and commerce. This was a great failing. Henceforth, we should have
unified plans and interrelated management.
<P>
The above is a summary of our opinions.
<p>
<B><I>(C) Commerce</I></B>
<P>
Our commerce began with a cooperative and it took six years to develop into
large-scale commerce.
<P>
In 1937, the brigade was sent across the Yellow River to the area around
Guoxian to fight the enemy. After the loss on Taiyuan, commerce was disrupted
and city goods could not be moved into the countryside. The common folk did
not dare to travel to buy goods. As a result there were great shortages of
daily necessities. Oil and salt were out of supply for a while. Both the
army and the people had to eat plain food. In these circumstances we set
up a cooperative at the request of the people. We allocated animals to go
to Ningwu and elsewhere for salt. The supply department put up 300
<B><I>yuan</I></B> to buy goods belonging to merchants which were stored
in the countryside. We contracted the merchant, Li Maolin, from Yangwu as
manager and set up business at Yangwu. It was called '359 Brigade Army-People
Cooperative'. The aim was simply to solve difficulties in the supply of salt,
oil and so forth, and to handle other necessary goods. At the time the currency
had not yet lost value, so, although the capital was small, business was
successful. In the short period of six months from October 1937 to April
1938 when the troops moved east, we gained great sympathy among the people
of the county. Thousands of people praised us saying that if it were not
for the cooperative, they would have died without being killed by the enemy.
Making a profit was not the aim at the time, so although business was good
we did not earn any money. At the end in April, the capital and profit of
490 <B><I>yuan</I></B> was handed over to the troops and used.
<P>
In May, 1938, the cooperative personnel went to the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border
Region with the troops. When they got to Lingqiu there was another shortage
of daily necessities. Both the people and the army suffered. They wanted
to continue with the cooperative but had no capital and could think of no
way. In August, the cooperative personnel went to the county town of Laiyu
county to build up relations with merchants. Through friendly connections
they bought goods worth 3,042 <B><I>yuan</I></B> on credit. Most of it consisted
of bolts of cloth, writing-materials, paper, soap and so forth totaling eleven
packs. They returned to Donghenanzhen east of Lingqiu and set up a shop.
The suppliers of the goods also came along. Within five days the goods were
entirely sold and they got a net profit of 800 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. They paid
the suppliers 2,042 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and presented 1,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> to the frontline troops for buying provisions. With the
800 <B><I>yuan</I></B> left over, they returned with the suppliers to Laiyuan
to get more goods. This process was repeated several times up until December
when the hill for goods was fully repaid. From August to December the operations
of the cooperative provided supplies of oil, salt and cloth needed by the
people of the Lingqiu region and earner 2,800 <B><I>yuan</I></B> to supplement
the troops' expenses. In addition there remained goods worth 1,500
<B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
In January 1939 we moved the 1,500 <B><I>yuan</I></B> worth of goods to
Xiaguanzhen. We mainly dealt in oil and salt, on the one hand supplying the
troops and on the other helping the ordinary folk. since the troops were
continuously engaging the enemy at this time, we had over 1,000 wounded.
It was not easy to get Western medicines and nutritious foods so the cooperative
set up good relations with various merchants and through them got Western
medicine, milk, arrowroot and so forth from Tianjin, Beijing, Baoding and
other places. This ensured the supply of necessities for the wounded. In
September 1939 the brigade received the order to take on the defence of the
Yellow River between Shanxi and Shaanxi. The cooperative was closed down.
The nine months' business brought in 9,400 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. When the troops
set off they had no money so 5,400 <B><I>yuan</I></B> was paid out in expenses.
The remaining goods worth 4,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> were brought west with
the troops in five donkey packs. In October we got to Wuliwan in Suide in
the Border Region, we sold them for 20,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> and we sent
people to Loufan, Wenshui and Jiaocheng to buy writing-materials and cloth.
By the end of the year we had 31,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> in goods and cash.
<P>
In January 1940 the cooperative moved to Nanguan in Suide. At that time the
troops' economy was in great difficulties. We could only rely on the earnings
of the cooperative to help pay expenses, so we felt the name 'Army-People
Cooperative' was not suitable and changed it into the ' Daguang Store' showing
that its goal had changed into making a profit. During that year we built
up friendships with some merchants and bought goods either for cash or on
credit. We bought writing-materials, cloth, paper, shoes, socks, towels and
so forth, and made a profit in the market. We worked hard and by the year-end
earned 191,700 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. We apportioned 101,700
<B><I>yuan</I></B> to the troops to help with the expenses, and kept 90,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> as capital for 1941.
<P>
In 1941 the brigade decided to expand its commercial activities as a supplement
to the major undertakings in agriculture, industry and transport in order
to meet the urgent requirements of the troops. Besides the existing 90,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> capital, a further 250,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> was given
from the 400,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> issued to the brigade by the Finance
Department for production capital. In addition all the small shops run by
the regiments were closed, and their capital of 60,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>
collected together. The town capital was 400,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Beginning
in January 1941 we set up ten branch shops. After a year's operation we got
a profit of 2,982,377 <B><I>yuan</I></B> of which 982,377
<B><I>yuan</I></B> was used to supplement the troops' expenses and 2 million
was kept as the store's capital.
<P>
In 1942, the store and ten branch shops got a profit of 6,720,080
<B><I>yuan</I></B> from operations during spring, summer and autumn. Two
million <B><I>yuan</I></B> were used to supplement expenditure for the troops
and the remaining sum of 4,720,080 <B><I>yuan</I></B> in use.
<P>
The lessons of experience are:
<P>
(i) We helped the ordinary folk to buy cloth, paper, oil, salt and other
necessities, and we strengthened relations between the army and the people.
<P>
(ii) We helped the troops to buy daily necessities by making it possible
for the soldiers' income of 1 <B><I>yuan</I></B> to purchase soap, towels,
toothbrushes, toothpaste etc., at a time when the Eighth Route Army was in
difficult economic circumstances. On the other hand, the troops rightfully
bought daily necessities with their money which reduced improper and wasteful
behaviour among the troops.
<P>
(iii) Building friendships is very important. If we had not had good relations
with the merchants of Laiyuan, we could not have bought goods.
<P>
(iv) Surplus income supplemented expenditure for our forces.
<P>
(v) We sold local products and put limits on goods from outside. However,
since we did not inspect strictly and provide firm leadership, some shops
could not carry out this work in a pleasant and integrated manner. They only
looked after narrow departmental interests and neglected all-round economic
construction.
<P>
(vi) Before 1940 we did not know much about setting up a Commercial information
network, and only knew how to work hard. As a result we suffered quite a
few losses from rises and few in prices. In 1941 we set up such a network
to report on the situation in various places and built up liaison with some
big merchants. We learned of rises and falls in prices at the right time.
Therefore we did not make losses of this kind in 1941 and 1942.
<P>
(vii) We liaised and worked together with local experienced merchants able
to operate outside the Border' Region. When we encountered difficulties in
the supply of raw materials for spinning and weaving, we obtained great help.
However, we also encountered some rogue merchants who used us to carry out
their own business, damaging our operations.
<P>
(viii) There were too many people working in the store not earning their
keep and adding to expenses.
<P>
(ix) Frequent contact with merchants from outside enabled us to understand
each other's policies and attitudes, reducing misunderstandings and building
friendships.
<P>
(x) We tested the cadres' Party spirit, thought and ability.
<P>
(xi) Only with strict administration and a correlate system of regulations
could the store reduce waste.
<P>
(xii) To help stabilize the currency, in 1940 the store changed Guanghua
banknotes.
<P>
(xiii) Comprehensive preparations, correct and lively application of trading
policies, staying within the scope of non-prohibited goods, selling local
products and selling necessities solved difficulties in the supply of goods
for the army and provided a profit.
<P>
(xiv) With the aim of earning money, after January 1941 all the brigade and
regimental cooperatives became part of the Daguang Store. The organization
took Suide as its centre and set up branches in Suide, Mizhi, Jiaxian, Wuqi,
Anding, Yanchuan and Yanchang. The brigade had the Daguang Store, and the
regiments had the branches.
<P>
(xv) Most personnel in the shops were soldiers given payments according to
their jobs. Employees were paid a wage according to their ability, strengths
and weaknesses.
<P>
(xvi) Most of the goods were bought from northwestern Shanxi during 1941.
Afterwards because of the enemy's mopping-up campaigns and the economic blockade
(the decline of the nationalist currency and the use of the puppet currency),
commodity prices rose. In addition because of our problems with capital,
we could not get much money to buy goods. Therefore using the slogan ' resist
the enemy's goods and sell local products', we sold the cloth we wove ourselves,
and the leather shoes, woollen towels and cloth shoes we produced ourselves.
We also sold Daguange soap in even greater quantities. To prevent unprincipled
merchants from raising market-prices and to promote the Border Region currency
we changed Guanghua banknotes, and lowered the rising market-prices. For
example, the salt we extracted ourselves we sold at 2 <B><I>jin</I></B> 4
<B><I>liang</I></B> per <B><I>yuan</I></B> compared to the market-price of
1 <B><I>jin</I></B> 4 <B><I>liang</I></B> per <B><I>yuan</I></B>. Thus we
enabled the ordinary folk to buy at cheaper prices. So we can say that in
a certain period our aim was not to earn money but to stabilize prices and
secure the people's livelihood
<P>
(xvii) 'If you knew what would happen in three days' time, you would be rich
for thousands of years.' It seems as if trading is a question of finding
the right way by accident. If you find a good opportunity, then you can earn
money. In fact it is not so. Trading relies entirely on correct estimation,
understanding of the situation locally and elsewhere, and understanding the
difference between imports and exports. Then you can forecast the rise and
fall in commodity prices, and fix the policies for attention in a certain
period.
<P>
(xviii) A stable currency and secured finances are the: primary conditions
for developing business. During the past three years the sudden rise and
fall in the value of the Border Region currency and the disruption of finances
has influenced trading in commodities and made everything difficult. Another
aspect is that this situation has enabled speculative merchants to deal in
currency notes. They have earned a lot of money and influenced the economy
of the Border Region.
<P>
(xix) The various regimental shops have in practice not thoroughly implemented
centralized leadership and have competed with each other. They have lacked
coordination which is an unhealthy tendency.
<P>
(xx) The various regiments have set up an accounting system run by specialists
who keep the accounts. However since too many of them were merchants in the
past, they did not use new methods of recording and still used the old.
<P>
A concrete plan for agricultural production In 1943 has been prepared by
359 Brigade. It is really clear and definite and may be supplied to all units
for consideration. The text follows.

<B>359 BRIGADE'S 1943 AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION PLAN</B>
<P>
The military farming system of the troops stationed in the Border Region
is one of the basic duties of our army in carrying out the policy of the
anti-Japanese national united front and in establishing new democratic politics.
Persisting in carrying out this duty enables us to lighten the people's burden,
improve the quality of the army and achieve close unity with the people from
a position of self-reliance and self-sufficiency. Therefore, in the light
of the experience and achievements in carrying out the call from upper levels
for production during the past three years, the brigade has drawn up the
following plan to strengthen the implementation t of this call and to increase
he quantity of production in 1943 .

<B><I>(A) How should we organize the troops' agricultural production?
</I></B>
<P>
(1) All the defence areas where the regiments and troops are stationed have
arable land, so we stipulate that each provisions unit should carry out
agricultural production according to its manpower and the land situation.
<P>
(2) In circumstances where the army is stationed in one place, each provisions
unit only needs three cooks for every hundred men. Therefore each provisions
unit can select six or seven strong comrades with agricultural experience
from among the cooks to specialize in farming.
<P>
(3) The deputy battalion head with responsibility for production in each
battalion, the head of the special duties in each company, and the deputy
officers with responsibility for production in the brigade and regiments
have the task of planning and inspection. During spring ploughing, summer
weeding and autumn harvesting, they should organize and lead all personnel
to take part.
<P>
(4) We stipulate that the provisions unit of each combat company, apart from
supplying all their own vegetables, should plant 600 <B><I>mu</I></B> of
grain. Table 8.3 lays down the tasks each unit can shoulder.

<P>

<B><I>(B) The year's plan relies on the spring. This winter we must prepare
for the work of the coming spring</I></B>
<P>
(l) Each provisions unit must make a clear register of the land to be planted,
how much mountain land, how much river land, how much land that has been
farmed, and how much uncultivated land. It must also work out what is going
to be planted and how much work, seed and so forth will be required for planting,
hoeing and harvesting.
<P>
(2) Farming requires oxen, ploughs, and other agricultural tools such as
hoes, rakes, baskets and sickles. These should be fully prepared in winter.
Actual requirements per provisions unit are three plough-oxen, three ploughs
and sixty other implements.
<P>
(3) If you do not use manure, the crops do not grow well. Every unit must
collect manure. All nightsoil, animal manure, and wood and straw ashes must
be gathered. Pay attention to control of lavatories, pig-sties, sheep-pens,
and oxen and horse-stables. We must put at least 4 <B><I>tan</I></B> of manure
on each <B><I>mu</I></B> of land. In many places there are grass roots from
flooded land and tree leaves. These can be moved to the farmed land for burning.
<P>
Table 8.4 lists the amount of preparatory work to be undertaken by all units
and by the brigade as a whole.

<P>
(2) How many workdays are required on 600 <B><I>mu</I></B>, from opening
up the land and sowing seed to harvesting? It is estimated that opening land
and sowing seed requires 500 days; preparation and spreading of manure, 800
days; three weddings, 1,800 days; and harvesting, 450 days. This makes 3,550
days in all.
<P>
Note: six cooks farming 600 <B><I>mu</I></B> throughout the year can do at
least 1,000 workdays; 3,550 work days minus 1,000 leaves 2,550. Each provisions
unit has a hundred men so each man has to do twenty-five days' agricultural
labour during the year.

<B><I>(D) The type of crops and the harvest</I></B>
<P>
(1) Find out what is the most suitable grain to be planted according to the
land. In general, plant spiked millet <B><I>[gu (zi)]</I></B>, millet
<B><I>[su], </I></B>goaliang, maize <B><I>[baogu]</I></B>, beans, rice and
so forth. In addition, also consider the needs of the troops and plant hemp
for sandals, lamp-oil and cooking-oil Some units can plant cotton.
<P>
The seventh regiment can plant 200 <B><I>mu</I></B> of cotton. Estimating
a harvest of 30 <B><I>jin</I></B> of cotton per<B><I> mu,</I></B> the total
will be 6,000 <B><I>jin</I></B>. At a value of 50 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per
<B><I>jin</I></B> this will be equal to 300,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
Each company in the special duties battalion <B><I>[tewuying]</I></B> should
plant 80 <B><I>mu</I></B> of cotton in addition to its 600
<B><I>mu</I></B> of grain. This can give an estimated harvest of 2,400
<B><I>jin</I></B> worth 120,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B>. The battalion headquarters
can plant 20 <B><I>mu</I></B> giving 600 <B><I>jin</I></B> worth 30,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
(2) Reckoning at 4 <B><I>tou</I></B> of hulled grain for every 3
<B><I>mu</I></B>, 600 <B><I>mu</I></B> can produce 80 <B><I>tan</I></B> of
hulled grain, and the 39,000 <B><I>mu</I></B> of the whole brigade can produce
5,200 <B><I>tan</I></B>. At a value of 1,250 <B><I>yuan</I></B> per
<B><I>tan</I></B>, the crop from 600 <B><I>mu</I></B> will be worth 100,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, and that of the brigade's 39,000 <B><I>mu</I></B>, 6
5 million <B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
(3) In each 600 <B><I>mu,</I></B> it is estimated that 300 will be planted
to spiked millet. Each <B><I>mu</I></B> will Produce 300
<B><I>jin</I></B> of<I> </I>hay giving a total of 90,000
<B><I>jin</I></B>. At a value of 1<I> <B>yuan</B></I> per
<B><I>jin</I></B>, 600 <B><I>mu</I></B> will produce hay worth 90,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>, and the whole brigade will produce hay worth 5,850,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
The harvest totals are given [in Tables 8.7 and 8.8].

<P>
After each regiment and unit has received this plan, it should at once call
a meeting of production cadres to discuss implementation. The general plan
for the regiment or unit and the plan for each provisions unit ( including
their own plans for vegetables, edible oil, lamp-oil, hemp for making sandals
and so forth for which they have been self-sufficient for three years) should
be reported upwards by the end of November. It is important that this should
be obeyed.
<P>
The above materials show us that the army's self-supporting production has
undoubtedly achieved a great deal. What have these achievements depended
on? These have depended on the active leadership of the cadres and the labour
enthusiasm of the troops. The cadres have given active leadership to the
production movement consciously in order to overcome difficulties in the
course of the revolution. The troops have taken part in productive labour
consciously in order to overcome difficulties in the course of the revolution.
If these two groups had not had this conscious awareness, if they had not
felt that their work was not for others but for themselves, not for some
worthless cause but for the sacred cause of the revolution, there would have
been no ways for them to fulfil these difficult production tasks. If they
had felt they were hired labourers, if they had felt that the production
they carried out had no relationship to their own interests and no relationship
to the common revolutionary cause, there would have been no way to fulfil
these production tasks.
<P>
Above we have discussed the fine experience and great achievements of our
army in self-supporting production. Below we shall again discuss the shortcomings
in our work.
<P>
Our work has shortcomings, and these shortcomings are not only found in the
army but also in the official organizations and schools. Some of these
shortcomings were unavoidable in the past. However, after five years' experience
we should be able to correct them. Some have already become serious abuses.
If we do not correct them, they will hinder the interests of the Party and
the revolution.
<P>
What are these shortcomings?
<P>
First, in order to solve urgent problems of self-sufficiency quickly some
army units and some official organizations and schools have relatively or
specially stressed commerce and neglected agriculture and industry. They
do not realize that only agriculture and industry produce value. Commerce
is merely a medium of circulation. It cannot produce any value itself. Warned
by experience, the production task for all forces and official organizations
and schools in 1943 is gradually to transfer the again emphasis to agriculture,
industry and transport. In our present circumstances, agriculture is particularly
important since the majority of the things we need are agriculture products
(staple grain, miscellaneous grain, vegetables, hemp, meat, vegetable-oil,
animal-oil, cotton, horse-fodder, timber, firewood, etc.). Agricultural products
can also be exported in exchange for industrial products. If we also undertake
some possible and necessary handicrafts (spinning yarn, spinning wool, making
shoes, weaving woollen thread and garments, digging coal, sawing wood, pressing
oil, etc.) and large light industry (textiles, papermaking), we can meet
the majority of our daily requirements and produce enough for trading.
<P>
The second shortcoming is that we lack unified planning and unified inspection.
Lower levels act without coordination and upper levels either do not have
or lack sufficient unified direction, planning and inspection of policy
principles and work content. As a result the various branches do not know
what they should not do, or do know but still do it. Thus instances of lack
of coordination or struggling for independence often occur. Incidents have
arisen where policy principles and government orders have been broken, where
the people's interests have been damaged, where various economic units have
not only not cooperated but have competed and hindered each other, where
the upper levels have been deceived and not the lower levels, or where both
have been deceived, where things have been kept back or where lies have been
told. There has been great waste, reckless spending, concentration on show
and not on results. Particularly serious are cases of the evils of bribery
and corruption among cadres. Some cadres have been enticed by material things
and are not loyal to the sacred cause of communism, having become completely
corrupt. Other cadres, have been poisoned, and can only get back to health
by drying out in the sun. All these bad things and all this corruption have
occurred to a lesser or greater extent among some parts of the army and in
some official organizations and schools. Henceforth, all upper-level leadership
organs in the army and the official organizations and schools must place
emphasis on looking after the whole situation and on grasping policy. They
must provide unified planning and inspection for the productive activities
of all subordinate units. They certainly must not permit the abuses described
above to occur again. If they do occur again, they must be strictly disciplined.
Less important cases should be criticized and serious ones punished. We certainly
cannot condone them or, to use a flattering term, 'have a liberal policy'.
These are the three work styles for rectification in economic work. We must
carry them out without the slightest delay.
<P>
The third shortcoming is that in the production activities of many army units,
official organizations and schools, the cadres responsible for administration
and control do not take many pains. A minority even pay no attention at all
and merely entrust every thing to the supply organ or to the general office.
This is because they still do not understand the importance of economic work.
And the reason they still do not understand it is because they have been
poisoned by the deceitful corrupting words off metaphysicisis like Dong Zhongshu,
'Conform to the required meets and do not seek gain, be concerned with the
way and do not plan for merit', and have not yet cast them fully aside. It
is also because they consider politics, Party and army affaires come first
and are most important, while economic work, although also important, is
not important to the same degree. They feel that they themselves do not have
to divide their attention or to give much attention by being concerned. However,
these attitudes are entirely wrong. In the present situation in the
Shaan-Kan-Ning Border Region, the great majority of people have work to do.
If you talk of revolution, then in the final analysis apart from economic
work and educational work (including theoretical education, political education,
military education, cultural education, technical education, professional
education and national education) what other work is worthy of the names
central or primary work? Is there any other work that is more revolutionary?
True, there is other work and a lot of it, but the central or primary work
for the majority of comrades in the present situation in the Border Region
is certainly economic work and educational work. All other work is only
significant in the context of these two. If we conscientiously carry out
these two items of work, we can consider that we have done well in supporting
the war at the front and in helping the people of the great rear areas. Of
the two, education (or study) cannot. be carried out alone. We are not in
a time when 'official rank lies in study'. We cannot go and 'conform to the
requirements and illuminate the way' with hungry stomachs. We must get food
to eat. We must pay attention to economic work. Talking of education or study
separately from economic work is merely using superfluous and empty words.
Talking of 'revolution' separately from economic work is like making revolution
against the Finance Department and against yourselves. The enemy will not
be in the least hurt by you. Because we have many comrades with leadership
responsibilities who still take the attitude of neglecting or not paying
much attention to economic work, many other comrades copy them, being willing
to do Party; government, army and educational work, or to work in literature
and art but unwilling to do economic work. Some female comrades are unwilling
to marry economic workers, imploring that they consider them dishonunrable.
They consider that marrying the head of a mule-and-horse-team would be an
insult and they would rather marry a political-worker. In fact all these
view-points are very wrong and do not match the situation in this time and
place. We must make a new division of labour. We need some revolutionary
specialists who are separate from production affairs. We also require some
doctors, literature and art workers, and so forth. But we do not want many
people like this. If there are too many then danger arises. If those who
eat are many and those who produce are few, if those who are employed suffer
and those who benefit are comfortable, we shall collapse. Therefore many
cadres must be transferred from their present work or study to economic posts.
Chief responsible cadres at all levels in the Party, government and army
must at the same time pay full attention to leading economic work. They must
investigate and study the content of economic work, be responsible for making
plans for economic work, allocate cadres for economic work, inspect the results
of economic work, and never again entrust this extremely important work to
the supply departments or general offices alone and wash their hands of it.
<P>
The fourth shortcoming is that in the past some army units and official
organizations have not had a division of labour between levels when allocating
production tasks. All levels from brigade to company and from upper level
to lower level have been permitted to run commerce without any limits. Thus
many defects have arisen. Henceforth most commerce, industry and transport
should be concentrated in brigades, in regiments working in independent areas
and in upper-level organs. Furthermore these must work according to correct
principles. Trade with the outside must be united under the direction of
the Commodities Bureau. Units under regiments working in an independent area,
units at battalion level or below, and most lower-level organs should be
instructed to carry out agriculture, handicrafts that can be done by troops
or miscellaneous personnel and business or trading of the consumer cooperative
type. They are not allowed to do other work.
<P>
In the light of achievements and Shortcomings over the past five years, the
concrete tasks for the various units of the army in 1943 are as follows:
<P>
(1) With the exception of most of the grain and some of the bedding and clothing
which are supplied by the government, the great majority of army units should
provide 80 per cent of their own supplies. Some units (such as 359 Brigade)
should provide 100 per cent. Only those in special circumstances (such as
the cavalry) can be allowed to bear a lighter production burden, and they
too should think of ways to provide more in 1944. All forces should prepare
to increase self-sufficiency in grain and clothing and bedding in 1944 so
as to reduce the burden on the people and to let them build up their strength.
<P>
(2) With the exception of 359 Brigade, which is already fully carrying out
the military farming system, or the cavalry, which would find it difficult
because of special circumstances to implement that system at once, and of
those with garrison duties, all other forces should carry out the policy
of military farming in individual units or several units together so as to
increase agricultural production.
<P>
(3) All units from top to bottom should carry out production in an organized,
led and planned way. Set up production committees at all levels from brigade
to company, and carry out collective planning and inspection at each level.
Study in production techniques so as to increase production and improve supplies.
Correct all irregular phenomena.
<P>
(4) Select cadres strong in politics and ability to administer production
and supply work in each department. Existing economic cadres should be examined.
Incompetents and those who have committed corrupt and decadent errors must
be transferred. Particularly serious cased must be punished. Every unit must
set up a deputy battalion head with responsibility for production and personnel
to administer production in companies. These people should specially control
production and the distribution of tasks for whole battalions and whole
companies. Brigade units and regimental units should establish deputy officers
with responsibility for production to administer the production work of the
units themselves. The commanding officer of each level must personally plan
and inspect economic work.
<P>
(5) All economic and financial work of the Party, government and army in
each sub-region should carry out coordinated cost-accounting under the leadership
of the finance sub-committee of the sub-region. In order to stimulate the
activism of the production and working personnel of all units, it should
permit them to spend a suitable amount of the results of their production
on improving their livelihood. Everything apart from this should be distributed
in a coordinated way so as to avoid the problem of unequal benefits. Some
coordinated distribution should be applied throughout the Border Region as
a whole, some within the sub-regions, some within the various systems, and
some within units. It can be decided according to the nature of production
and the economic situation.
<P>
(6) Implement the policy of 'giving consideration to both the army and the
people'. The economic activities of the army, Party and government should
harmonize with the economic activities of the people. Anything which damages
the people's interests or causes them dissatisfaction is not allowed.
<P>
(7) Production and education cannot be out of balance. All units must carefully
plan both kinds of work and their mutual relationships. Correctly share out
the time for each so that production and education in 1943 can be greater
and better than in 1942. We have had five years' experience and it is entirely
possible to achieve this aim..
<P>
(8) The core of the army's political work is to ensure the fulfilment of
its production and education plans, to ensure that while it is carrying out
these plans there are correct relationships with the Party, government, and
people, to ensure the correct relationship between upper and lower levels
within the army itself, and to ensure the purity of economic cadres. If political
work does not fulfil its own task in these areas then it will be defeated.
