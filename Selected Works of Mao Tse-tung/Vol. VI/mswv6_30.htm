  IDEALISM AND MATERIALISM
</H4>
<H4>
  1. THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN TWO ARMIES IN PHILOSOPHY
</H4>
<P>
The whole history of philosophy is the history of the struggle and the
development of two mutually opposed schools of philosophy -- idealism and
materialism. All philosophical currents and schools are manifestations of
these two fundamental schools.
<P>
All philosophical theories have been created by men belonging to a definite
social class. The ideas of these men have moreover been historically determined
by a definite social existence. All philosophical doctrines express the needs
of a definite social class and reflect the level of development of the productive
forces of society and the historical stage in men's comprehension of nature
. . .
<P>
The social origins of idealism and materialism lie in a social structure
marked by class contradictions. The earliest appearance of idealism was the
product of the ignorance and superstition of savage and primitive man. Then,
with the development of the productive forces, and the ensuing development
of scientific knowledge, it stands to reason that idealism should decline
and be replaced by materialism. And yet, from ancient times to the present,
idealism not only has not declined, but, on the contrary has developed and
carried on a struggle for supremacy with materialism from which neither has
emerged the victor. The reason lies in the division of society into classes.
On the one hand, in its own interest, the oppressing class must develop and
reinforce its idealist doctrines. On the other hand, the oppressed classes,
likewise in their own interest, must develop and reinforce their materialist
doctrines. Both idealism and materialism are weapons in the class struggle,
and the struggle between idealism and materialism cannot disappear so long
as classes continue to exist. Idealism, in the process of its historical
development, represents the ideology of the exploiting classes and serves
reactionary purposes. Materialism, on the other hand, is the world view of
the revolutionary class; in a class society, it grows and develops in the
midst of an incessant struggle against the reactionary philosophy of idealism.
Consequently, the history of the struggle between idealism and materialism
in philosophy reflects the struggle of interests between the reactionary
class and the revolutionary class&#133;. A given philosophical tendency is
in the last analysis a manifestation in a particular guise of the policy
of the social class to which the philosophers belong.
<P>
The distinguishing characteristic of Marxist philosophy -- i.e., dialectical
materialism -- is its effort to<I> </I>explain clearly the class nature of
all social consciousness (including philosophy). It publicly declares a resolute
struggle between its<B> </B>own proletarian nature and the idealist philosophy
of the propertied class. Moreover, it subordinates its own special and
independent tasks to such general tasks as overthrowing capitalism, organizing
and building a proletarian dictatorship, and edifying a socialist society.
<H4>
  2. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IDEALISM AND MATERIALISM.
</H4>
<P>
Wherein lies the basic difference between idealism and materialism? It lies
in the opposite answers given by the two to the fundamental question in
philosophy, that of the relationship between spirit and matter ( that of
the relationship between consciousness and existence). Idealism considers
spirit (consciousness, concepts, the subject) as the source of all that exists
on earth, and matter (nature and society, the object) as secondary and
subordinate, Materialism recognizes the independent existence of matter as
detached from spirit and considers spirit as secondary and subordinate..
<H4>
  3. THE SOURCE OF THE GROWTH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF IDEALISM.
</H4>
<P>
Idealism see matter as the product of the spirit. This is turning the real
world upside down. Where is the source of the growth and the development
of such a philosophy?
<P>
As mentioned above, the earliest manifestation of idealism was brought about
by the superstition and ignorance of primitive, savage man. But with the
development of production, the separation between manual labour and intellectual
labour was responsible for ranking idealism first among currents of philosophical
thought. With the development of the productive forces of society, the division
of labour made its appearance; the further development of the division of
labour saw the emergence of persons devoting themselves entirely and exclusively
to intellectual labour. But when the productive forces are still weak, the
division between the two does not reach the stage of complete separation.
Only after classes and private property appear and exploitation becomes the
foundation of the existence of the ruling class do great changes occur.
Intellectual labour then becomes the exclusive privilege of the ruling class.
while manual labour becomes the fate of the oppressed classes. The ruling
class begins to examine the relationship between themselves and the oppressed
classes in an upside-down fashion<B>:</B> It is not the labourers who furnish
them with means for existence, but rather they who supply the labourers with
these means. Hence, they despise manual labour and develop idealist conceptions.
To eliminate the distinction between manual labour and intellectual labour
is one of the preconditions for eliminating idealist philosophy.
<P>
The social root that makes possible the development of idealist philosophy
lies principally in the fact that this kind of philosophical consciousness
is the manifestation of the interests of the exploiting class ... The final
decline of idealism will come with the elimination of classes, after the
establishment of a communist society.
<P>
The source that enables idealism to develop and deepen and gives it the strength
to struggle with materialism must be sought in the process of human knowing..
When men think, they must use concepts. This can easily cause our knowledge
to be split into two aspects<B>:</B> reality, which is of an individual and
particular character; and concepts, which are of a general character... In
the nature of things, the particular and the general are inseparably linked;
once separated, they depart from objective truth... To separate the general
from the particular, and to view the general as objective reality and the
particular merely as the form in which the general exists&#151; this is the
method adopted by all idealists. All idealists put consciousness, spirit,
or concepts in place of objective reality existing independently from human
consciousness... They cannot point out the materialist truth according to
which consciousness is limited by matter, but believe that only consciousness
is active, whereas matter is only an inert composite entity. Urged on moreover
by their own class nature, the idealists then use every method to exaggerate
the activity of consciousness, developing this aspect unilaterally... Idealism
in economics exaggerates beyond measure a nonessential aspect of exchange,,
raising the law of supply and demand to the status of the fundamental law
of capitalism... Idealist historians regard heroes as the makers of history.
Idealist politicians regard politics as omnipotent. Idealist military leaders
practice the methods of desperate combat <I>[p'ing-ming-chu-i-ti tso-chan].
</I>Idealist revolutionaries advocate Blanquism. The diehards say that the
only way to revive our nation is to restore the old morality. All this results
from exaggerating subjective factors beyond measure...
<P>
Pre-Marxist materialism (mechanistic materialism) did not stress the thought
process in the development of knowledge, but regarded thought merely as the
object of action, as the mirror that reflects nature... Only dialectical
materialism correctly shows the active role of thought, and at the same time
points out the limitation imposed upon thought by matter. It points out that
thought arises from social practice and at the same time actively shapes
practice. Only this kind of dialectical theory of the unity of knowledge
and action can thoroughly vanquish idealism.
<H4>
  
  4. THE ORIGIN OF THE INCEPTION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MATERIALISM
</H4>

The recognition that matter exists independently and apart from consciousness
in the external world is the foundation of materialism. Man created this
foundation through practice...

Obliged to submit to natural forces, and capable of using only simple tools,
primitive man could not explain the surrounding phenomena and hence sought
help from spirits. This is the origin of religion and idealism.

But in the long-range process of production, man came into contact with
surrounding nature, acted upon nature, changed nature, and created things
to eat, to live in, and to use, and adapted nature to the interests of man
and caused man to believe that matter has an objective existence.
<P>
In the social existence of humanity, reciprocal relationships and influences
arise between individuals. In a class society there is moreover a class struggle.
The oppressed class considers the circumstances and estimates its strength,
and then makes its plans. When they succeed in the struggle, the members
of this class are convinced that their views are not the product of fantasy,
but the reflection of the objectively existing material world. Because the
oppressed class fails when it adopts the wrong plans and succeeds by correcting
its plans it learns to understand that it can achieve its purpose only when
its subjective plans rest upon the accurate understanding of the material
nature of the objective world and the fact that the objective world is governed
by laws.

The history of science furnishes man with proof of the material nature of
the world and of the fact that it is governed by laws and helps man to see
the futility of the illusions of religion and idealism and to arrive at
materialist conclusions.

In sum, the history of man's practice comprises the history of his struggle
with nature, the history of the class struggle, the history of science. Owing
to the necessity to live and struggle, men have thought about the reality
of matter and its laws, have proved the correctness of materialism, and have
found the necessary intellectual tool for their struggle&#151; materialist
philosophy. The higher the level to which social production develops, the
greater the development of the class<B> </B>struggle, and the more scientific
knowledge reveals the &#145;secretes&#146; of nature, the greater the development
and consolidation of materialist philosophy. Thus man can be delivered gradually
from the dual and crushing oppression of nature and society. . &nbsp;

  DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM
</H4>
<H4>
  
  1. DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM IS THE REVOLUTIONARY ARM OF THE PROLETARIAT
</H4>
<p>
The Chinese proletariat, having assumed at the present time the historical
task of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, must make use of dialectical
materialism as its mental-arm... The study of dialectical materialism is
even more indispensable for the cadres who lead the revolutionary movement,
because the two erroneous theories and methods of work of subjectivism and
mechanism frequently subsist among the cadres, and as a result frequently
cause the cadres to go against Marxism, and lead the revolutionary movement
on to the wrong path. If we wish to avoid or correct such deficiencies, the
only solution lies in conscious study and understanding of dialectical
materialism, in order to arm one's brain anew.
<H4>
  2.&nbsp; THE RELATION BETWEEN THE OLD PHILOSOPHICAL HERITAGE AND DIALECTICAL
  MATERIALISM
</H4>
<p>
After the May 4th Movement of 1919, as a consequence of the conscious appearance
of the Chinese proletariat on the political stage, and the rise in the scientific
level of the country, a Marxist philosophical movement arose and developed
in China. In its first period, however, the level of understanding of materialist
dialectics within the materialist current of thought was rather weak, and
mechanistic materialism influenced by the bourgeoisie, as well as the
subjectivism of Deborin, were its principal components. Following the defeat
of the revolution in 1927 the level of understanding of Marxism and Leninism
progressed, and the thinking of materialist dialectics gradually developed.
Just recently, because of the severity of the national and social crisis,
and also because of the influence of the movement for liquidating deviations
in Soviet philosophy, a broad movement of materialist dialectics has<B>
</B>developed in China's intellectual circles.
<p>
Because of the backwardness of China's social development the dialectical
materialist philosophical currents developing in China today do not result
from taking over and reforming our own philosophical heritage, but from the
study of Marxism-Leninism. However, if we wish to ensure that dialectical
materialist thought shall penetrate profoundly in China and continue to develop,
and shall moreover give firm direction to the Chinese revolution and lead
it to final victory in the future, then we must struggle with all the old
and rotten philosophical theories existing in China on the ideological front
throughout the whole country, raise the flag of criticism and in this way
liquidate the philosophical heritage of ancient China. Only thus we can attain
our goal.
<H4>
  
  3. THE UNITY OF WORLD VIEW AND METHODOLOGY IN DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM
</H4>
<p>
Dialectical materialism is the world view of the proletariat. At the same
time it is the method of the proletariat for taking cognizance of the surrounding
world, and the method of revolutionary action of the proletariat. It is the
unity of world view and methodology&#133;.
<H4>
  
  4. THE QUESTION OF THE OBJECT OF MATERIALIST DIALECTICS -- WHAT DO MATERIALIST
  DIALECTICS SERVE TO STUDY?
</H4>
<p>
Marx, Engels and Lenin all explained materialist dialectics as the theory
of development...
<p>
Under the heading of the object of philosophy we must still solve another
problem, namely the problem of the unity of dialectics, logic and epistemology.
. .
<p>
Materialist dialectics is the only scientific epistemology, and it is also
the only scientific logic. Materialist dialectics studies the origin and
development of our knowledge of the outside world. It studies the transition
from not knowing to knowing and from incomplete knowledge to more complete
knowledge; it studies how the laws of the development of nature and society
are daily reflected more profoundly and more extensively in the mind of humanity.
This is precisely the unity of materialist dialectics with epistemology...
<p>
The essence of the concept of development consists in regarding laws as the
reflection in and transplanting to our minds (moreover further elaborated
in our minds) of the manifestations of the movement of matter...
<p>
Only by using materialism to arrive at a solution of the problem of the relations
between existence and thought, only by taking one's stand on the theory of
the reflection, can one arrive at a thorough solution to the problems of
dialectics, logic and epistemology&#133;.
<H4>
  
  5. ON MATTER
</H4>
<p>
The very first condition for belonging to the materialist camp consists in
recognizing the independent existence of the material world, separate from
human consciousness -- the fact that it existed before the appearance of
humanity, and continues to exist since the appearance of humanity, independently
and outside of human consciousness. To recognize this point is a fundamental
premise of all scientific research.
<p>
How shall we demonstrate this? The proofs are extremely numerous. Humanity
is constantly in contact with the external world and must, moreover, struggle
fiercely against the pressure and resistance of the outside world (nature
and society). Moreover, we not only must, but can overcome this pressure
and resistance. All of these real circumstances of the social practice of
humanity, as manifested in the historical development of human society, are
the best proof [of the existence of the material world ]. China does not
doubt the objective existence of Japanese imperialism which has invaded our
country, nor of the Chinese people themselves. The students of the Anti-Japanese
Military-Political University also do not doubt the objective existence of
this university and of the students themselves...
<p>
If we consider this thing known as consciousness in the light of thoroughgoing
materialism ( that is to say in the light of materialist-dialectics), then
what we call consciousness is nothing else but a form of the movement of
matter, a particular characteristic of the material brain of humanity; it
is that particular characteristic of the material brain which causes the
material processes outside consciousness to be reflected in consciousness.
From this we see that when we distinguish matter from consciousness and when,
moreover we oppose them one to another, this is only conditional that is
to say, it has meaning only from the standpoint of epistemology.. &#133;
&#133; &#133;.
<p>
In a word, matter is everything in the universe. 'All power belongs to Ssu-Ma-
I.' We say, &#145;All power belongs to matter.' This is the source of the
unity of the world.
<H4>
  
  6. ON MOVEMENT (ON DEVELOPMENT)
</H4>
<p>
The first fundamental principle of dialectical materialism lies in its view
of matter... This principle of the unity of the world has already been explained
above in discussing matter.
<p>
The second fundamental principle of dialectical materialism lies in its theory
of movement (or theory of development). This means the recognition that movement
is the form of the existence of matter, an inherent attribute of matter,
a manifestation of the multiplicity of matter. This is the principle of the
development of the world. The combination of the principle of the development
of the world with the principle of the unity of the world, set forth above,
constitutes the whole of the world view of dialectical materialism. The world
is nothing else but the material world in a process of unlimited
development&#133;
<p>
Dialectical materialism's theory of movement is in opposition first of all
with philosophical idealism and with the theological concepts of religion.
The fundamental nature of all philosophical idealism and religious theology
derives from their denial of the unity and material nature of the world;
and in imagining that the movement and development of the world takes place
apart from matter, or took place at least in the beginning apart from matter,
and is the result of the action of<B> </B>spirit, God, or divine forces,
The German idealist philosopher, Hegel, held that the present world results
from the development of the so-called 'world idea'. In China the philosophy
of the Book of Changes, and the metaphysics of the Sung and Ming, all put
forward idealist views of the development of the universe. Christianity says
that God created the world, Buddhism and all of China's various fetishist
religions attribute the movement and development of all the myriad phenomena
<I>(Wan Wu)</I><B><I> </I></B>of the universe to spiritual forces. All of
these doctrines which think about movement apart from matter are fundamentally
incompatible with dialectical materialism...
<p>
Dialectical materialism... considers that rest or equilibrium are merely
one element of movement, that they are merely one particular circumstance
of movement... A sentence popular with the metaphysical thinkers of ancient
China, 'Heaven does not change and the Way also does not change,' corresponds
to... a theory of the immobility of the universe. . . In their view, the
basic nature of the universe and of society was eternally unchanging. The
reason why they adopted this attitude is to be found primarily in their class
limitations. If the feudal landlord class had recognized that the basic nature
of the universe and of society is subject to movement and development, then
most certainly they would have been pronouncing in theory a death sentence
on their own class. The philosophies of all reactionary forces are theories
of immobilism. Revolutionary classes and the popular masses have all perceived
the principle of the development of the world, and consequently advocate
transforming society and the world; their philosophy is dialectical materialism..
<p>
The causes of the transformation of matter is to be found not without, but
within. It is not because of the impulsion of external mechanical forces,
but because of the existence within the matter in question of two components
different in their nature and mutually contradictory which struggle with
one another, thus giving an impetus to the movement and development of the
matter. As a result of the discovery of the laws of such movement and
transformation, dialectical materialism is capable of enlarging the principle
of the material unity of the world, extending it to the history of nature
and society. Thus, not only it is<I> </I>possible to investigate the world
considered as matter in perpetual movement, but the world can also be
investigated as matter endlessly in movement from a lower form to a higher
form. That is to say, it is possible to investigate the world as development
and process.
<p>
Dialectical materialism investigate the development of the world as a progressive
movement from the inorganic to the organic, and from thence to the highest
form of the movement of matter (society).
<p>
What we have just discussed is the theory of the movement of the world, or
the principle of the development of the world in accordance with dialectical
materialism. This doctrine is the essence of Marxist philosophy. If the
proletariat and all revolutionaries take up this consistently scientific
arm, they will then be able to understand this world, and transform the world.
