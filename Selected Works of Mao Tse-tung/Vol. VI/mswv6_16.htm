  <A NAME="s1">1. THE GREAT VICTORY</A>
</H4>
<P>
&nbsp;
<p>
Under the call of the party and the Central [Soviet] Government the land
investigation campaign has been unleashed widely. If we assume that the land
investigation campaign in the past was merely in the initial stage, then
the land investigation of eight counties during June<I> </I>has achieved
more than what has been accomplished over the half year since winter. Generally
speaking, in the eight counties that have held meetings, the land investigation
campaign has advanced to a new phase having become a broad mass movement.
Achievement in two counties, Juichin and Posheng are the greatest, and they
have searched out two thousand and several hundred households of landlords
and rich peasants, while the counties, Shengli, Yutu, Which'ang, Tingtung,
Ch&#146;angting, Shihch'eng and Nighua, all have achieved initial results.
In all the districts and <I>hsiang</I> that have achieved results in the
land investigation a broad mass struggle has been unleashed. Many stalemate
situations which prevailed in the past in the soviet work and in the party
work have now become active. Many undesirable elements in the Soviets have
been washed out, and the counter-revolutionary elements who were hidden in
the countryside have been dealt with severe punishments. In a word, the feudal
remnant forces have suffered disastrous defeat before the broad masses. On
this basis various activities are ever more unfolded. In the regions where
some results were achieved in the land investigation, the expansion of the
Red Army and local armed forces, the promotion of economic construction bonds,
and the growth of cooperatives, as well as the programs of culture building
like clubs, evening classed, and primary schools, all have gained extremely
great achievements and all the work is being carried through ever more smoothly.
Based on the activeness of the masses, large numbers of activists have joined
the party on their own, and are drawn into the soviet&#146;s work. The best
example is Jentien District of Juichin. With the assistance of the Central
Government Work Corps the land investigation campaign in Jentien has spurred
the masses of the entire district who have in fifty-five days, thoroughly
stamped out the feudal remnants, searched out some three hundred landlord
and rich peasant families, twelve counter-revolutionaries, for execution
and suppressed counter-revolutionary activities; they have arrested among
the soviet war personnel, the class heretics who have sneaked into the [district]
soviet. The entire district has searched out a land of 22,000
<B><I>mou</I></B> (<B><I>mou</I></B> - 0.0614 ha) and some 20,000 toiling
masses in the district have each acquired in average an additional land of
one <I>mou</I> and two <I>mou</I> and were distributed countless belongings
of the <I>haoshen</I> and landlords. Relying on the unprecedented height
of mass activism, they have expanded the Red Army [detachments] in fifty-five
days by some 700 people, who have joined the Juichin Model Division, without
a single person deserting. They have saved grains, to sell to the Red Army,
which amounted to some 1900 <I>tan. </I>No other district of the whole county
can match it. At the instance of various <I>hsiang</I> the entire district
assumed the promotional sale of economic construction bonds worth 40,000
<I>yuan</I>. Landlord fines and rich peasant taxes which were collected totalled
7,500 <I>yuan</I> and those that can be continually raised will be 10,000
<I>yuan</I>. Cooperatives have grown rapidly and the institutions of culture
and education such as clubs, study classes, evening classes also have increased.
The number of party members has expanded and the leadership of the party
has been strengthened. The labour union work, too, has moved forward. The
entire district has transformed, to breath a fresh spirit. From one of the
backward district of Juichin, it has altered its status in fifty-five days
and became a first rate district comparable to Wuyang. We now want to ask:
Why has Jentien District achieved such a great result? That we should point
out: because of their understanding of the import of the task of land
investigation and because of their formula of mobilization, their class line
and their mass work, which have been resolutely carried out according to
the correct directives of the Central Bureau [of the Soviet Areas ] and the
Central Government, they have performed a genuine Bolshevik work. In the
way of appreciating the task, they were aware that the land investigation
campaign and the revolutionary war are closely linked together. Hence, they
have carried through this task in earnest, firmly grasped the leadership
of the land investigation campaign, and developed the local work systematically.
In the way of the mobilization formula, they firmly grasped -the work of
the most and relatively backward seven <I>hsiang</I> among the eleven
<I>hsiang</I> of the entire district. In these seven <I>hsiang</I> Soviets
they mobilized the labour unions, poor peasant corps and other mass organizations
through which they went out to mobilize the broad masses. In the way of the
class line they resolutely executed the tactic of relying on the hired hands
and poor peasant in alliance with the middle peasants, thus broadly developing
the poor peasant corps. They explained that land investigation is not land
distribution and that class examination is not to examine the class of the
middle and poor peasants and hired hands. The work of "class talk" has been
done very sufficiently. When the landlords and rich peasants of Wofeng
<I>hsiang</I> intimidated the middle peasants and drove a section of them
into panic, our comrades paid a visit to several middle peasants and talked
to them individually. After they had relayed [the talk] to other middle peasants,
the middle peasants of Wofeng <I>hsiang</I> began to quiet down immediately.
Actively supported by the land investigation policy of the <I>[hsiang]
</I>Soviet they [the middle peasants] have moved into a joint attack on the
landlords and rich peasants, from whom they have endured extortions previously,
along with the poor peasants and hired hands. Comrades in Jent'ien District
have once incorrectly classified the status of several peasant families but
they have promptly corrected the mistake. As for directing the mass work,
they first of all conducted widespread propaganda. What they held was not
a district-wide or <I>hsiang</I>-wide meeting but a village or residence
meeting. Thus they got access to the broader masses for whom they have repeatedly
conducted propaganda and agitation. Therefore, the masses of the entire district
have come to understand clearly that the landlord investigation and class
examination are their own responsibility and that they are for their own
interests. They then went on to investigate class status, they spurred many
people to go out to investigate, gathering data in detail on each status
was decided first through the analysis of the land investigation committee,
which was then referred to the poor peasant corps for discussion and
confirmation. It was further sent to the District Soviet for approval. Again,
it was sent back to the concerned village to hold a meeting for further
explanation and approval by a show of hands, and then the confiscation was
executed. In distributing the property as well as the land, all the working
personnel understood that they ought to be exemplary, not to take things
but to distribute them entirely among the masses, allocation more to the
village directly involved in the confiscation, and less to other villages.
Thus they obtained complete satisfaction from the masses. The land was also
promptly distributed. While the land elsewhere was distributed only after
a prolonged delay, there was no such a phenomenon in Jent&#146;ien District.
Hence, it promptly spurred the masses. Their method of first breaking into
large and backward villages, was also correct. They had no fear of these
large villages, nor did they employ barbarous methods to deal with them.
What they did with regard to the large villages was to concentrate fire power
on them, making more and more propaganda beginning with local activists,
to unit and educate them, and through them they reached out to other masses.
With great patience they went on to carry through the village, the work of
this nature. In appearance it looked tedious but in practice it was fast.
In a period of fifty-five days they have spurred without exception all the
large backward villages of Jent&#146;ien District and in a very short time
stamped out backwardness of these villages. They could not break into a village
of Pok&#146;ang <I>hsiang</I><B><I>. </I></B>There were previously two "big
tigers" who were restive all the time. They took a different method. First
they captured these two rascals and convicted them in circuit court held
in the locality. With the masses&#146; enthusiastic support they were executed
by a firing squad. Thereupon the mass struggle became intensive like a violent
fire. They held ten mass tribunals and three circuit courts. All these followed
the extremely broad mass line with many residents of the
<I>hsiang</I><B><I> </I></B>attending and other <I>hsiang</I><B><I> </I></B>
sending representatives from each village - a small <I>hsiang</I><B><I>
</I></B> sending a score of people or so, a large <I>hsiang</I><B><I>
</I></B>forty to fifty people. Therefore, every public trial and the result
of a tribunal were all at once relayed to the <I>hsiang</I><B><I> </I></B>
and all villages of the entire district. It enabled them not only to punish
or execute individuals who deserved it, but also to think immediately that
the same dealing will have to be accorded to similar evil doers in their
own locality. The land investigation campaign in Jent&#146;ien District can
truly be regarded as a model for all the Soviet Areas! The work in Chiupao
District of Juichin has achieved an extremely great result. They first firmly
grasped three <I>hsiang</I><B><I> </I></B>to work on. They called members
of the land investigation committee of each <I>hsiang</I><B><I> </I></B>to
attend a three-day training session in the District Soviet, where the
mobilization formula, the class line, and the method of winning the masses
were clearly discussed. They initiated a measure for the problem of confiscation
and distribution. Their measure has been that, in confiscation a landlord
household, they called upon the masses of the village and the household to
go together to a mass meeting where a confiscation and distribution committee
was selected. Under the surveillance of the masses they proceeded to the
confiscation, piling up the confiscated items on the terrace. Again with
the masses&#146; consent, they immediately distributed them to the masses
who deserved. Edible items also called for disposal, that is, letting the
people have a hearty eating together, slaughtering hogs and cooking rice.
This measure in Chiupao District has scored the maximum effectiveness. Since
their confiscation and distribution committee was not a standing organization
but a provisional one, it has greatly enhanced intimate relations with the
masses (with regard to the confiscation and distribution of land, it was
still assumed by the regular land committee). It did not require all the
items to be carried to the <I>hsiang</I> soviet nor did it have to concentrate
on a certain number of households only before taking up the distribution
in others. It has thus avoided the shortcoming of being procrastinated and
things being stolen away in the meanwhile. Like the class line and the work
method in Chiupao District they were also generally correct. Therefore, they
could spur the broad masses to commence the class examination on their own.
They have carried it through in such a way that not a single landlord or
rich peasant came to the <I>hsiang</I><B><I> </I></B>Soviet or District Soviet
to dispute his status; it was completely different from the land investigation
of the past. In the past there were after all many landlords and rich peasants
who had been classified, came to the Soviet for nuisance, arguing that they
had been incorrectly classified. Not only the persons themselves but also
even a <I>hsiang</I><B><I> </I></B>representative and the man in charge of
the poor peasant corps came on their behalf of testify. This time, naturally,
not only did they make no nuisance, but they could not do so even if they
wanted to. Not a single person of the clans and relatives came to their
assistance. There was no possibility for them to make fuss as their power
was shorn off. This even proves that Chiupao District has been extremely
thorough in spurring the masses. Otherwise, it was impossible to carry it
through to this extent.&nbsp;
<p>
All these glorious exemplary instances (the instances of this type are still
many elsewhere) have given a Bolshevik reply to the call of the party and
the Central Government and have proven the absolute correctness of the directives
of the Central Bureau and the Central Government. Whenever these directives
were completely carried through, great victory was at once won. Whoever betrayed
or ignored these directives, however, he committed mistakes in his work,
achieved little or no result. Let me prove it again with facts.
<p>
<H4>
  
  <A NAME="s2">2. SOME PLACES HAVE GIVEN UP THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LAND
  INVESTIGATION CAMPAIGN</A>
</H4>

<p>
In the combat task of the land investigation campaign, after the Central
Bureau issued the resolution on the land investigation, after the Central
Government decreed the land investigation, and after the Eight-County Conference
on Land Investigation was convened, the land investigation campaign in various
counties has not spread to all the places. For instance, the result of the
land investigation in the entire province of Fukien was comparable only to
that of one county alone i.e. Posheng. The result even in each of the counties
Shengli, Yutu, Huich&#146;ang, and Shihch'eng was comparable only to that
of one or two best districts of Juichin [County]. Many land investigation
committees in various districts, as well as a few counties, have not firmly
grasped the work of a [district-wide or] county-wide land investigation
(Huich'ang, Yutu, Shihch&#146;eng, and Ninghua). In many districts and
<I>hsiang</I> land investigation committees, district and
<I>hsiang</I>[soviet] chairmen did not assume leadership on the plea of being
preoccupied elsewhere and left the land investigation unattended. As for
the Party's leadership in the land investigation, in places where achievements
were made in land investigation it has been clearly demonstrated that the
party's leadership role has been resolute. The majority of the rank and file
of the party has engaged in numerous combat programs with Bolshevik bravery
under the leadership of the branch and district committees. In places where
little or no achievement was made, however, it has been demonstrated that
the party organs have ignored the land investigation campaign. For instance,
after the Central Bureau's resolution on the land investigation was issued,
the Huich&#146;ang County Committee has not even once discussed the land
investigation work for nearly two months. Not until the end of July did it
hold a meeting to discuss the land investigation. The Hsiahsiao District
Committee of Juichin [County] has entirely left the land investigation campaign
unattended over a period of time. Ward committees of Juichin City, though
held a meeting once, did not push forward the suburban branches to head the
leadership of land investigation, while each branch did not hold any meeting
on the land investigation campaign. At other places like Yutu, Shengli,
Shihch&#146;eng, and Ninghua, the county committees and many district committees
have not likewise exerted real efforts at paying attention to the land
investigation work. The party and the Central Government stated that : "The
land investigation campaign has become a struggle to spur the masses and
deeply penetrate the rural classes and a powerful method to thoroughly resolve
the land question and purge the feudal and semi-feudal [forces]" (the Central
Bureau&#146;s Resolution); that "the land investigation campaign is the task,
which the soviets in various places cannot allow to relax for a moment" (the
Central Government's Decree ); and that "the land investigation campaign
is a most Principal link' of the present work" (Conclusion of the Eight-County
Conference). Nevertheless many of our comrades stated that they.... "were
very busy and have no time to attend to the land investigation campaign."
The Party Resolution stated: "To handle the land investigation campaign with
a perfunctory attitude of bureaucratism and formalism is most harmful."
Notwithstanding, these comrades handled the land investigation campaign with
the style of bureaucratism.
<p>
<H4 ALIGN=Center>
  <A NAME="s3">3. IN CERTAIN PLACES THE PARTY HAS SURRENDERED TO THE LANDLORDS
  AND RICH PEASANTS</A>
</H4>
<p>
<p>
In places where the land investigation campaign has been unleashed, there
are yet many individual but serious mistakes. That is to say, in these local
Party organs and soviets there appeared frequently some individual comrades
who have manifested their opportunistic vacillations in the land investigation
campaign which is a violent class struggle. Mainly, when the land investigation
campaign was undergoing violent development they could not forsake clannish
and parochial relations and covered up the landlords and rich peasants of
the same clan and the same village, or they made an incorrect analysis of
class status by classifying a landlord as a rich peasant and a rich peasant,
a middle peasant Some comrades working in the tribunal department have accepted,
out of their extreme inadvertence, slanderous charges against those who were
active in the land investigation, made by the landlords and rich peasants
in the false name of the masses. On the other hand, we had some comrades
in the security bureau as well as the tribunal department who could not keep
up with the masses in pushing forward the struggle for class examination
and in suppressing the counterrevolutionaries vigorously. Even when the masses
made a request for arrest and execution by a firing squad of the landlords
and rich peasants who had resisted the land investigation, some of them did
not honor their request. For instance, the tribunal department of Juichin
made many mistakes like this.
<p>
<H4>
  
  <A NAME="s4">4. THE TENDENCY TO ENCROACH UPON THE MIDDLE PEASANTS IS THE
  MOST SERIOUS DANGER</A>
</H4>
<p>
<p>
The tendency of "left" opportunism occurred again in very many places during
the land investigation of July. What should be pointed out emphatically here
is the tendency to encroach upon the middle peasants, though it was clearly
stated in the Central Bureau's Resolution that: "Special attention must be
focused on the alliance with the middle peasants who will be the broadest
basic masses in rural soviets after the revolution. All our treatments and
policies must win their approval and support. Every decision of the poor
peasant corps and the soviet must have the support of the middle peasantry,
secured through a village or residence meeting. All the voices of the middle
peasant masses must be heard with care, and any attempt to encroach upon
the interests of the middle peasantry must be severely dealt with". In the
summary of the Eight-County Conference it was pointed out that: "The aim
of the land investigation is to examine classes and not to redistribute the
land", "alliance with the middle peasantry should start with non-encroachment
of the interests of the middle peasants", "in the beginning of the land
investigation we should make widespread propaganda to the effect that the
soviet policy is to ally with the middle peasantry, not to encroach upon
them. In the process of land investigation we should carefully determine
the uncertain elements between the middle peasants and the rich peasants
as not to misplace them." But these directives were not heeded by comrades
in many places. The land investigation in the confines of Juichin, once under
way, has proceeded to examine the middle peasants, house by house and
<I>mou</I> by <I>mou</I> so much so that it drove them to panic. In the end
they rushed to the soviet to ask for reclassification of their status into
poor peasants. They argued that: "To be a middle peasant is very dangerous,
for one would become a rich peasant if stretched. Change to a poor peasant,
for it is a bit far way from becoming a rich peasant." Does not such a despairing
voice merit our attention? Comrades in Yangku <I>hsiang</I> of Huangpo District
have told the masses: "Class examination is not for examining others, but
only to examine the middle and rich peasant and landlord classes". Comrades
in T'aching District have investigated so exhaustively by putting up markings,
that it has caused the same panic among the middle peasants. In the Conclusion
of the Eight-County Conference it was already stated that such an idea as
to assume that the land investigation is one of putting up markings is not
correct." However, these comrades did not pay heed to it at all. This method
of such an exhaustive investigation by markings has appeared in every county.
this is an extraordinarily serious situation. They have mixed up the land
investigation for the land distribution. But if this method is to be employed
in the land investigations campaign it would confound the objective of the
struggle in the villages. In the past we pointed out that: " Land investigation
and land distribution must be strictly distinguished. Such a distinction
is to be made not only for consolidating the land ownership of peasants so
as not to cause panic out of the ill-defined land distribution, but also
for victory in the struggle for class Examination. We must concentrate all
our energy, particularly in alliance with the middle peasants, to cope with
the resistance of the landlords and rich peasants. In such an event we should
not allow any dispute to take place within the ranks of peasants themselves"
(Conclusion of the Eight-County Conference). Such a tactic is a most important
part of the whole strategy in our leadership of the struggle of land
investigation. Nevertheless it was what many comrades had still neglected.
Such a negligence cannot be tolerated again, even for a moment. Those who
have been admonished but still deliberately continue these mistakes, must
be meted out with severe punishments by the higher soviet of the locality.
We need to wage thorough struggle within the party and youth league against
the idea and action of any party or youth league members who encroach upon
the interests of the middle peasants and violate the strategy of alliance
with the middle peasants. In places where mistakes are already committed
by confiscating, for example, the property and land of the middle peasant,
the soviet personnel should publicly admit their mistakes to the middle peasants
in the locality and should redeem them forthwith. That Hsiangkuo County
reinstituted many lands of the middle peasants last year, thus to win their
satisfaction, is a very valuable lesson.
<p>
&nbsp;
<H4 ALIGN=Center>
  <A NAME="s5">5. CLOSED-DOOR-ISM OF THE POOR PEASANT CORPS AND ITS NEGLIGENCE
  OF THE LEADERSHIP ROLE OF THE HIRED HANDS ARE WRONG</A>
</H4>
<p>
<p>
"Poor peasant masses are the pillars of the party and the proletariat in
the countryside and are the resolute supporters of a thoroughgoing execution
of the land revolution" "To rely on the poor peasants" is one of our important
policies in the land investigation and in all the struggles for land, the
poor peasant corps is the organization that plays an extremely important
role [here]. The Eight-County Poor Peasant Corps Representatives' Conference
has already pointed out that the past tendency of closed doorism of the poor
peasant corps was wrong, and that the system of introduction should be discarded,
and that the door should be kept wide-open to the poor peasants and workers
so that they, male and female, old and young, can all apply and join. In
many places, however, the old method is still being followed and remains
unchanged; without introduction one still cannot join the poor peasant corps.
Worse still, when non-member poor peasant masses in T'aching District of
Juichin had rushed to attend a poor peasant corps meeting, the man-in-charge
of the corps simply refused to admit them. In Chuchajen District Of Posheng,
the poor peasant corps did not admit even a single person during the month
of July. In all the districts and <I>hsiang</I> where the land investigation
has gained results, the poor peasant corps has developed broadly and in places
where the land investigation has gained no or little result, the phenomenon
there is that the poor peasant corps is in the state of closed doorism. Likewise,
the great leadership role of the hired hands in the land investigation campaign
was not appreciated by many comrades. The Party Resolution stated: "The masses
of the hired hands, who are brothers of the urban proletariat in the countryside,
are the vanguard of the land revolution. Hence, the working personnel in
the soviets must maintain close contact with the [ rural] labour unions through
which activism of the masses of the [ rural ] workers can be developed and
organized in order to make them the vanguard of the land investigation campaign.
" Our Comrades who have carried work according to this directive are still
few in number. The principal method here is to have the rural workers join
up the poor peasant corps and set up within it individual small groups of
workers. Through these workers' small groups <I>[hsio-tsu] </I>we should
go out to unite poor peasant activists, develop the poor peasant corps, and
promote advancement of the land investigation campaign. The experience in
Shanho <I>hsiang</I> of Huangpo District is valuable. When our comrades there
twice failed to convene a poor peasant corps meeting, they held a joint meeting
of the rank-and-file members of the agricultural labour union and the handicraft
labour union and spurred a few dozen workers to arise actively so that they
each bring a poor peasant to join the poor peasant corps. On the following
day the poor peasant corps again convened a meeting to which all attended
as anticipated, and thus unleashed the land investigation campaign. This
experience in Shanho <I>hsiang</I> should be employed in all the villages.
The high-level leadership organs of the labour unions here should provide
the low-level labour unions with positive leadership so as to regard the
task of land investigation as one of the important tasks of the unions.
<p>
<H4 ALIGN=Center>
  <A NAME="s6">6. THE INCORRECT IDEA ABOUT THE QUESTION OF RICH PEASANTS</A>
</H4>
<p>
&nbsp;
<p>
Our entire strategy in the agrarian struggle is to depend on the poor peasants,
to resolutely ally with the middle peasants, to enable the poor peasants
to play the vanguard role, and to unite all the revolutionary forces in order
to eliminate the landlord class and combat the rich peasants. Concerning
the question of rich peasants the party has already correctly stated: "We
must clearly distinguish the landlord from the rich peasant. In the unrelenting
struggle to eliminate the landlord remnants we must under no circumstances
allow any attempt to eliminate the rich peasantry. " During the land
investigation of July, we have not yet found a theory openly advocating the
elimination of the rich peasants but we found the phenomenon in many places
in which a rich peasant element was treated as a landlord thereby confiscating
all his family property. The origin of this mistake is due to the elimination
of labour power of the rich peasant. When we stated that "those who possess
no labour power or only incidental labour power and exploit rent for land
are landlords," in some places those who employed a considerable number of
labouring elements in production, which was [thus] considered a kind of "
incidental labour power," were construed as landlords. In some places the
rich peasants who concurrently practiced usurious exploitation were regarded
as "usurers", such rich peasants were treated in accordance with the measures
of "eliminating usurers." In some places, old accounts were settled by going
back to some years prior to the [1925-271 Revolution; someone who had employed
regular farmhand five to six years or even a dozen years or so before the
Revolution were also regarded as rich peasants; or well-to-do middle peasants
who had employed regular farmhand merely for one or two years and have since
never done so were also thrown into the rich peasant category. Even more
serious was the case in the past in a certain place of Hsiangkuo County.
The method there differentiated the landlords from the rich peasants by the
type and extent of exploitation. Those who practiced three kinds of exploitation
were called landlords, two kinds rich peasants. For instance, if one has
hired regular farmhand, collected rent, and also extended loans, he was in-short
classified as a landlord regardless of how many people there were [then]
in that family who could work. There was also the question of "reactionary
rich peasants " which turned out to be considerable absurdity in many places.
In Wuyang District there was a rich peasant family who was also a merchant
having seven people to feed. In the past a member of the family who had joined
the A-B Corps was killed two years ago. Because of this, comrades there,
two years later, insisted that they must confiscate the entire [family] property.
In many other places many a similar incident took place. Many of' the masses
demanded punitive measures against those rich peasants who, prior to the
Uprising, had taken part in, not very serious, counter-revolutionary activity,
like participating in the type of "collecting thirty percent rent in grain"(as
in Juichin), and have not since taken part in any counter-revolutionary activity
over the post-Uprising years; and some of our comrades wanted, of necessity,
to confiscate their property. Correctly speaking, our measure of dealing
with the [ rich peasant ] elements of this type should be different in tactics
in the consolidated region and in the non-consolidated region and in the
non-consolidated border region. In the border region, unquestionably we employ
a strict method of suppressing all the counter-revolutionary elements including
the rich peasants; in the Central Area it should be determined according
to situations. Those who have committed a serious counter-revolutionary action
prior to the Uprising or those who are still engaged in counter-revolutionary
activity should of course be subjected to resolute confiscation. Others should
not be subjected to confiscation. Except the person in a certain family and
the elements who are directly involved with him in counter-revolutionary
activity, other people should not be subjected to confiscation. Such will
be the correct treatment.

<H4>
  
  <A NAME="s7">7. THE DEPARTMENT OF THE WORKERS' AND PEASANTS' INSPECTION HAS
  NOT ASSUMED ITS OWN RESPONSIBILITY AND COMMITTED SOME MISTAKES</A>
</H4>
<p>
&nbsp;
<p>
Many of our comrades in the department of the workers' and peasants' inspection
do not understand that the duration of the land investigation campaign is
the best opportunity to commence a thorough struggle, to combat bureaucratism,
corruption and passive sabotage, and to drive class heretics out of the soviet
[organs]. Our work on these elements has been extraordinarily inadequate.
Many of our comrades in the department of the workers' and peasants' inspection
have demonstrated, in the face of this violent class struggle, their passivism
and vacillations, and their bureaucratism and formalism. In some extreme
cases, for instance, the chief of the section of the workers' and peasants'
inspection of the Municipal Soviet of Juichin and the chief of the tribunal
section of the Municipal Soviet of Paopi committed an exceedingly serious
crime of corruption [embezzlement of some 1,000 y<I>uan</I> of public funds).
The chief of the section of the workers' and peasants' inspection of Tut'ou
District neither criticized nor arrested the chairman of the District Soviet
who has abandoned and neglected the land investigation campaign. In some
places the prosecution drive of the department of workers' and peasants'
inspection has again gone into another wrong direction by treating the question
of love as decadent and the taking of things of landlords as corrupt. They
proceeded to prosecute these elements even on public trial. In some places
they dismissed those who committed trivial mistakes in their duties, and
they did not initiate self-criticism systematically to commence a thorough
struggle. They spared themselves with this arduous work and substituted a
simplified punitism for it. Needless to say, those among the working personnel
of the soviets who committed chronic and serious ,mistakes should be washed
out resolutely, but to dismiss from duties those, whose mistakes did not
reach this extent is an excess. As to the question of class heretics, it
generally concerns only one&#146;s class origin, not one's work; only if
one's background happens to be bad is he called a class heretic, and is dismissed
regardless of how long a history of struggle he has behind him, regardless
of how correctly he has carried on the policy of the party and soviet in
the past and at present. True, we should resolutely wash out those class
heretics and should without question wash out those whose class origin is
bad and whose work is also bad (including the landlords, rich peasants, passive
saboteurs and corrupt and decadent elements ) . But if those who are not
in this category are to be purged, it is an excess.

  <A NAME="s8">8. ON THE ART OF LEADERSHIP IN THE LAND INVESTIGATION STRUGGLE</A>
</H4>
<p>
<p>
If we understand the task and policy and yet if we do not possess the Bolshevik
art of leading the mass struggle we still cannot commence the land investigation
campaign. In the opening of this essay mention has been made of very many
good examples of leading the struggle in the places like Jent&#146;ien District
and others but in many others places many mistakes were committed over this
question. In some places we did now know how to use various methods to spur
the struggle in the large backward villages where the landlords and rich
peasants were concentrated. That is to say, if such a large village existed,
we should first of all capture the most notoriously bad <I>haoshen</I> and
landlords whom the masses called "big tigers." Only this way can we initiate
the struggle in the locality. Nevertheless our comrades did not do this way.
As regards the best method to spur the mass struggle through the utilization
of the distribution of the confiscated items, they did not know how to use
it in many places. In Watzu <I>hsiang</I> of T'aching District of Juichin
they distributed things, worst of all, only to land investigation cadres
and poor peasants corps members while issuing none to others. The reason
was that if one was not active he does not deserve it. In some places the
distribution of confiscated things was very slow. In some extreme cases even
when a month or so has passed after confiscation, distribution to the masses
was not done. The distribution of the confiscated land was even more slower.
Comrades in quite a few places did not know how to mobilize various departments
of the soviets and mass organizations; nor did they know how to mobilize
the available party and youth league members to play the nucleus leadership
role in the mass organizations, villages and residences. Unable to push forward
the work they said there had been no way out here at the outset. In some
places with the mass struggle for class examination already in full swing,
many people came to report on the landlords and rich peasants and asked for
examination and confiscation. At the time comrades could not immediately
seize on the popular enthusiasm to lead the masses to further the struggle
so as to carry the work of class examination into the villages. In some places,
when the popular zeal in struggle, after a round of investigation, could
not continue to surge upward and reached the state of stalemate, our comrades
were unable to use various methods to invigorate the masses, to make the
struggle continually surge upward leading right up to the stage of eliminating
all the feudal remnants. In many places, when the mass zeal in struggle,
after going through the land investigation campaign, had erupted, they did
not know how to organize the zeal of this sort into other fronts. For instance,
when the masses did secure things and land, they did not then at the mass
meeting or at all other propitious opportunities incite the masses to enlist
in the Red Army, purchase public bonds, to join cooperatives, to accelerate
the harvest work and autumn cultivation, to set up clubs and study groups,
and to develop evening and primary schools. They missed such a best opportunity,
and only until the high-level [organ] pressed for these did they start all
over again to wage propaganda and agitation. Such a leadership of tailism,
following behind the poplar enthusiasm in struggle is the most harmful one
to the revolutionary work.&nbsp;
<p>
In many other places, on the other hand, there occurred again the evil phenomenon
of savagery by a few people. We have emphasized that, in combatting the apathy
in winning a great majority of the masses and the work style of commandism,
we only need to be persevering and enduring with the work of spurring and
winning the masses. Only then can we gain the support of the great majority
of the masses and reach the goal of eliminating the feudal remnants. Such
a mass work is the only guarantee for executing the class line. The land
investigation campaign should commence a broad propaganda in all the villages
and residences, to expound to the masses the need of the land investigation
campaign, explaining that the land investigation is<I> </I>not a land
distribution, and that the class examination is<I> </I>not to examine the
classes of middle and poor peasant and farmhand. Particularly important is
to give a clear analysis as to what constitutes landlords, rich and middle
peasants. Village and residence meetings should not be held only once.
Especially, backward villages and residences should hold more than one meeting
and should not let a single person of the revolutionary masses get away from
listening to our propaganda. To reach this goal we should first explain clearly
to all the active elements in the representative council of the <I>hsiang</I>
soviet, labour unions, poor peasant corps, women workers' and peasants'
associations, as well as other mass organizations, through whom we should
wage propaganda to the broad masses. Class examination should be carried
out not by a few people but by sparring many people. Passage of class status
should be made not merely by the poor peasant corps, the <I>hsiang</I> soviet,
and the district soviet, but by a mass meeting held in the village or residence
of the confiscates to secure popular approval; only then can confiscation
be carried out. In distributing assets, we should issue them to the people
of the village or residence involved to win popular satisfaction. All this
is to win a great majority of the masses. The working personnel of the party
and soviet should not lose sight of the great majority of the masses on every
occasion and in every work. The masses we should face up to is the great
majority of the masses; the deepening of our work among the masses is to
penetrate the masses in all the villages, large or small, and in all the
cities and towns, large or small. We should strictly combat the mistaken
method of closed doorism and commandism followed by a minority. Our comrades
in many places, however, have never done [their work] this way. In Juichin
[ County ], there are very many districts and <I>hsiang</I> where not one
class discussion has been held with the masses (no analysis has been made
as to what constitutes landlords, rich and middle peasants). In many places
of Juichin and other counties it was discovered that they just set out to
investigate [classes ] in every instance without going through propaganda
so as to drive the landlords and rich peasants to fabricate rumors and cheat
the middle peasants or say that there were very many landlords and rich peasants
in the <I>hsiang</I> or state that there were a few hundred landlord families
who were going to be investigated (Juichin). Furthermore, our comrades did
not know clearly the method of conducting "class talk's" to break up this
kind of rumor. Landlords in Kuangch'an said: "The land investigation is<I>
</I>what the Central Government is going to make those who did not pay debt
in the past, pay their debt to the Central Government". Yet our comrades
did not go out immediately to break and expose such a devilish talk. In Several
<I>hsiang</I> of T&#146;aching District they not only did not wage any
propaganda, but the class examination was undertaken merely by a few people
of :the land investigation committee. Passage of class [status] did neither
go through the mass meeting nor through the poor peasant corps. They said:
"The masses are unreliable and do not know how to analyze classes. To bring
up class status at the mass meeting for passage is to cause dispute. It is
all the more reliable to have it passed by the land investigation committee
alone." This theory of the comrades in T'aching District can truly be a fantastic
story in the whole world! In goodly many places landlords and their properties
were confiscated not in the daytime but in the evening. The only reason was
that they were afraid that the landlords would run way. In one place a mass
meeting was held using the technique of holding an "all-district meeting
but no more than a couple or hundred of people attended. Three people took
turns to speak from the morning to the afternoon not letting the masses take
intermissions, nor letting them drink water or eat. They said that they were
afraid that the masses would run away. Such a barbarous method can also be
a fantastic one of its kind.

  <A NAME="s9">9. DEVELOP A TWO-FRONT STRUGGLE TO OVERCOME THE MISTAKES AND
  WIN A THOROUGH &nbsp;VICTORY IN THE LAND INVESTIGATION CAMPAIGN</A>
</H4>
<p>
&nbsp;
<p>
Undoubtedly the land investigation campaign has been unleashed over vast
areas. However. when this campaign is in progress, when we correctly estimate
the achievement already gained and consolidate the foundation of growth of
the campaign, we should yet realize with vigilance, obstacles to be encountered
in the course of the campaign. Only through the unleashing of the fire power
of the two-front struggle to clear away these obstacles, can we advance the
land investigation campaign even more rapidly. To start the fight against
the Rightist thought, to combat the underestimation of the grave significance
of the land investigation campaign, to combat the compromise and the surrender
to the landlords and rich peasants, and to combat the tailism in leadership
of the mass struggle, are the responsibility of every Communist Party member.
At the same time, attention of all the party members should be focused on
the danger of encroaching on the middle peasants and a "severe blow should
be dealt to any attempt to violate the interests of the middle peasants,"
for this is the sufficiently serious danger which has been manifested in
the present work of land investigation. Incorrect ideas about the rich peasants,
too, will undoubtedly affect the middle peasants. All barbarous acts of
commandism are of the greatest harm to the alliance with the middle peasants.
Only upon elimination of all obstacles in the course of the land investigation
campaign by the fire power of the two-front struggle, the campaign will make
great strides forward, and its thorough victory will be sufficiently assured.
