<h3>
1. What Is Guerrilla Warfare?
</h3>

<hr class="end" />


<p>
In a war of revolutionary character, guerrilla operations are a necessary
part. This is particularly true in war waged for the emancipation of a people
who inhabit a vast nation. China is such a nation, a nation whose techniques
are undeveloped and whose communications are poor. She finds herself confronted
with a strong and victorious Japanese imperialism. Under these circumstances,
the development of the type of guerrilla warfare characterized by the quality
of mass is both necessary and natural. This warfare must be developed to
an unprecedented degree and it must co-ordinate with the operations of our
regular armies. If we fail to do this, we will find it difficult to defeat
the enemy.
</p>
<p>
These guerrilla operations must not be considered as an independent form
of warfare. They are but one step in the total war, one aspect of the
revolutionary struggle. They are the inevitable result of the clash between
oppressor and oppressed when the latter reach the limits of their endurance.
In our case, these hostilities began at a time when the people were unable
to endure any more from the Japanese imperialists. Lenin, in <em>People and
Revolution</em>,<sup class="ednote"><a href="#A" name="Ab">[A]</a></sup> said: 'A people's insurrection and a people's revolution
are not only natural but inevitable.' We consider guerrilla operations as
but one aspect of our total or mass war because they, lacking the quality
of independence, are of themselves incapable of providing a solution to the
struggle.
</p>
<p>
Guerrilla warfare has qualities and objectives peculiar to itself. It is
a weapon that a nation inferior in arms and military equipment may employ
against a more powerful aggressor nation. When the invader pierces deep into
the heart of the weaker country and occupies her territory in a cruel and
oppressive manner, there is no doubt that conditions of terrain, climate,
and society in general offer obstacles to his progress and may be used to
advantage by those who oppose him. In guerrilla warfare we turn these advantages
to the purpose of resisting and defeating the enemy.
</p>
<p>
During the progress of hostilities, guerrillas gradually develop into orthodox
forces that operate in conjunction with other units of the regular army.
Thus the regularly organized troops, those guerrillas who have attained that
status, and those who have not reached that level of development combine
to form the military power of a national revolutionary war. There can be
no doubt that the ultimate result of this will be victory.
</p>
<p>
Both in its development and in its method of application, guerrilla warfare
has certain distinctive characteristics. We first will discuss the relationship
of guerrilla warfare to national policy. Because ours is the resistance of
a semi colonial country against an imperialism, our hostilities must have
a clearly defined political goal and firmly established political
responsibilities. Our basic policy is the creation of a national united
anti-Japanese front. This policy we pursue in order to gain our political
goal, which is the complete emancipation of the Chinese people. There are
certain fundamental steps necessary in the realization of this policy, to
wit:
</p>
<p class="indentb">
  1. Arousing and organizing the people.
<br />
  2. Achieving internal unification politically.
<br />
  3. Establishing bases.
<br />
  4. Equipping forces.
<br />
  5. Recovering national strength.
<br />
  6. Destroying enemy's national strength.
<br />
  7. Regaining lost territories.
</p>
<p>
There is no reason to consider guerrilla warfare separately from national
policy. On the contrary, it must be organized and conducted in complete accord
with national anti-Japanese policy. It is only who misinterpret guerrilla
action who say, as does Jen Ch'i Shan, "The question of guerrilla hostilities
is purely a military matter and not a political one." Those who maintain
this simple point of view have lost sight of the political goal and the political
effects of guerrilla action. Such a simple point of view will cause the people
to lose confidence and will result in our defeat.
</p>
<p>
What is the relationship of guerrilla warfare to the people? Without a political
goal, guerrilla warfare must fail, as it must, if its political objectives
do not coincide with the aspirations of the people and their sympathy,
co-operation, and assistance cannot be gained. The essence of guerrilla warfare
is thus revolutionary in character. On the other hand, in a war of
counter-revolutionary nature, there is no place for guerrilla hostilities.
Because guerrilla warfare basically derives from the masses and is supported
by them, it can neither exist nor flourish if it separates itself from their
sympathies and co-operation. There are those who do not comprehend guerrilla
action, and who therefore do not understand the distinguishing qualities
of a people's guerrilla war, who say: 'Only regular troops can carry on guerrilla
operations.' There are others who, because they do not believe in the ultimate
success of guerilla action, mistakenly say: 'Guerrilla warfare is an
insignificant and highly specialized type of operation in which there is
no place for the masses of the people' (Jen Ch'i Shan). Then there are those
who ridicule the masses and undermine resistance by wildly asserting that
the people have no understanding of the war of resistance (Yeh Ch'ing, for
one). The moment that this war of resistance dissociates itself from the
masses of the people is the precise moment that it dissociates itself from
hope of ultimate victory over the Japanese.
</p>
<p>
What is the organization for guerrilla warfare? Though all guerrilla bands
that spring from the masses of the people suffer from lack of organization
at the time of their formation, they all have in common a basic quality that
makes organization possible. All guerrilla units must have political and
military leadership. This is true regardless of the source or size of such
units. Such units may originate locally, in the masses of the people; they
may be formed from an admixture of regular troops with groups of the people,
or they may consist of regular army units intact. And mere quantity does
not affect this matter. Such units may consist of a squad of a few men, a
battalion of several hundred men, or a regiment of several thousand men.
</p>
<p>
All these must have leaders who are unyielding in their policies&#151;resolute,
loyal, sincere, and robust. These men must be well-educated in revolutionary
technique, self confident, able to establish severe discipline, and able
to cope with counter-propaganda. In short, these leaders must be models for
the people. As the war progresses, such leaders lack of discipline which
at first will gradually overcome the lack of discipline which at first prevails;
they will establish discipline in their forces, strengthening them and increasing
their combat efficiency. Thus eventual victory will be attained.
</p>
<p>
Unorganized guerrilla warfare cannot contribute to victory and those who
attack the movement as a combination of banditry and anarchism do not understand
the nature of guerrilla action. They say, 'This movement is a haven for
disappointed militarists, vagabonds, and bandits' (Jen Ch'i Shan), hoping
thus to bring the movement into disrepute. We do not deny that there are
corrupt guerrillas, nor that there are people who under the guise of guerrillas
indulge in unlawful activities. Neither do we deny that the movement has
at the present time symptoms of a lack of organization, symptoms that might
indeed be serious were we to judge guerrilla warfare solely by the corrupt
and temporary phenomena we have mentioned. We should study the corrupt phenomena
and attempt to eradicate them in order to encourage guerilla warfare, and
to increase its military efficiency. 'This is hard work, there is no help
for it, and the problem cannot be solved immediately. The whole people must
try to reform themselves during the course of the war. We must educate them
and reform them in the light of past experience. Evil does not exist in guerrilla
warfare but only in the unorganized and undisciplined activities that are
anarchism,' said Lenin, in <em>On Guerrilla Warfare</em>.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#B" name="Bb">[B]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
What is basic guerrilla strategy? Guerrilla strategy must be based primarily
on alertness, mobility, and attack. It must be adjusted to the enemy situation,
the terrain, the existing lines of communication, the relative strengths,
the weather and the situation of the people.
</p>
<p>
In guerrilla warfare, select the tactic of seeming to come from the east
and attacking from the west; avoid the solid, attack the hollow; attack;
withdraw; deliver a lightning blow, seek a lightning decision. When guerrillas
engage a stronger enemy, they withdraw when he advances; harass him when
he stops; strike him when he is weary; pursue him when he withdraws. In guerilla
strategy, the enemy's rear, flanks, and other vulnerable spots are his vital
points, and there he must be harassed, attacked, dispersed, exhausted and
annihilated. Only in this way can guerrillas carry out their mission of
independent guerrilla action and coordination with the effort of the regular
armies. But, in spite of the most complete preparation, there can be no victory
if mistakes are made in the matter of command. Guerilla warfare based on
the principles we have mentioned and carried out over a vast extent of territory
in which communications are inconvenient will contribute tremendously towards
ultimate defeat of the Japanese and consequent emancipation of the Chinese
people.
</p>
<p>
A careful distinction must be made between two types of guerrilla warfare.
The fact that revolutionary guerrilla warfare is based on the masses of the
people does not in itself mean that the organization of guerrilla units is
impossible in a war of counter-revolutionary character. As examples of the
former type we may cite Red guerilla hostilities during the Russian Revolution;
those of the Reds China; of the Abyssinians against the Italians for the
past three years; those of the last seven years in Manchuria, and the vast
anti-Japanese guerrilla war that is carried on in China today. All these
struggles have been carried on in the interest of the whole people or the
greater part of them; all had a broad basis in the national manpower and
all have been in accord with the laws of historical development. They have
existed and will continue to exist, flourish, and develop as long as they
are not contrary to national policy.
</p>
<p>
The second type of guerrilla warfare directly contradicts the law of historical
development. Of this type, we may cite the examples furnished by the White
Russian guerrilla units organized by Denikin and Kolchak; those organized
by the Japanese; those organized by the Italians in Abyssinia; those supported
by the puppet governments in Manchuria and Mongolia, and those that will
be organized here by Chinese traitors. All such have oppressed the masses
and have been contrary to the true interests of the people. They must be
firmly opposed. They are easy to destroy because they lack a broad foundation
in the people.
</p>
<p>
If we fail to differentiate between the two types of guerrilla hostilities
mentioned, it is likely that we will exaggerate their effect when applied
by an invader. We might arrive at the conclusion that 'the invader can organize
guerrilla units from among the people'. Such a conclusion might well diminish
our confidence in guerrilla warfare. As far as this matter is concerned,
we have but to remember the historical experience of revolutionary struggles.
</p>
<p>
Further, we must distinguish general revolutionary wars from those of a purely
'class' type. In the former case, the whole people of a nation, without regard
to class or party, carry on a guerrilla struggle that is an instrument of
the national policy. Its basis is, therefore, much broader than is the basis
of a struggle of class type. Of a general guerrilla war, it has been said:
'When a nation is invaded, the people become sympathetic to one another and
all aid in organizing guerrilla units. In civil war, no matter to what extent
guerrillas are developed, they do not produce the same results as when they
are formed to resist an invasion by foreigners' <em>(<B>Civil War in
Russia</B></em>). The one strong feature of guerrilla warfare in a civil struggle
is its quality of internal purity. One class may be easily united and perhaps
fight with great effect, whereas in a national revolutionary war, guerrilla
units are faced with the problem of internal unification of different class
groups. This necessitates the use of propaganda. Both types of guerrilla
war are, however, similar in that they both employ the same military methods.
</p>
<p>
National guerrilla warfare, though historically of the same consistency,
has employed varying implements as times, peoples, and conditions differ.
The guerrilla aspects of the Opium War, those of the fighting in Manchuria
since the Mukden incident, and those employed in China today are all slightly
different. The guerrilla warfare conducted by the Moroccans against the French
and the Spanish was not exactly similar to that which we conduct today in
China. These differences express the characteristics of different peoples
in different periods. Although there is a general similarity in the quality
of all these struggles, there are dissimilarities in form. This fact we must
recognize. Clausewitz wrote, in <B><em>On War</em></B>: 'Wars in every period
have independent forms and independent conditions, and, therefore, every
period must have its independent theory of war.' Lenin, in <B><em>On Guerrilla
Warfare </em></B>said: 'As regards the form of fighting, it is unconditionally
requisite that history be investigated in order to discover the conditions
of environment, the state of economic progress and the political ideas that
obtained, the national characteristics, customs, and degree of civilization.'
Again: 'It is necessary to be completely unsympathetic to abstract formulas
and rules and to study with sympathy the conditions of the actual fighting,
for these will change in accordance with the political and economic situations
and the realization of the people's aspirations. These progressive changes
in conditions create new methods.'
</p>
<p>
If, in today's struggle, we fail to apply the historical truths of revolutionary
guerrilla war, we will fall into the error of believing with T'ou Hsi Sheng
that under the impact of Japan's mechanized army, 'the guerrilla unit has
lost its historical function'. Jen Ch'i Shan writes: 'In olden days guerrilla
warfare was part of regular strategy but there is almost no chance that it
can be applied today.' These opinions are harmful. If we do not make an estimate
of the characteristics peculiar to our anti-Japanese guerrilla war, but insist
on applying to it mechanical formulas derived from past history, we are making
the mistake of placing our hostilities in the same category as all other
national guerrilla struggles. If we hold this view, we will simply be beating
our heads against a stone wall and we will be unable to profit from guerrilla
hostilities.
</p>
<p>
To summarize: What is the guerrilla war of resistance against Japan? It is
one aspect of the entire war, which, although alone incapable of producing
the decision, attacks the enemy in every quarter, diminishes the extent of
area under his control, increases our national strength, and assists our
regular armies. It is one of the strategic instruments used to inflict defeat
on our enemy. It is the one pure expression of anti-Japanese policy, that
is to say, it is military strength organized by the active people and inseparable
from them. It is a powerful special weapon with which we resist the Japanese
and without which we cannot defeat them.
