  LETTER TO THE<BR>
  YENAN PEKING OPERA THEATRE<BR>
  AFTER SEEING<BR>
  'DRIVEN TO JOIN THE LIANGSHAN MOUNTAIN REBELS'
</H1><p class="title">
January 9, 1944
<p class="information">
[<I>The Peking opera 'Driven to Join the Liangshan Mountain Rebels' is an
episode from Shui Hu Chuan ('Heroes of the Marshes', 'Water Margin' or 'All
Men Are Brothers'), the fourteenth-century classical novel. It tells how
Lin Ch'ung spurred on by the strength shown by the people, resolved to join
their rebellion against the reactionary rulers.</I>]

<p>
Having seen your performance, I wish to express my thanks to you for the
excellent work you have done. Please convey my thanks to the comrades of
the cast! History is made by the people, yet the old opera (and all the old
literature and art, which are divorced from the people ) presents the people
as though they were dirt, and the stage is dominated by lords, and ladies
and their pampered sons and daughters. Now you have reversed this reversal
of history and restored historical truth, and thus a new life is opening
up for the old opera. That is why this merits congratulations. The initiative
you have taken marks an epoch-making beginning in the revolutionization of
the old opera. I am very happy at the thought of this. I hope you will write
more plays and give more performances, and so help make this practice a common
one which will prevail throughout the country.
