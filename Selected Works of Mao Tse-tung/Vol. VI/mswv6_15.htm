<P class="information">
[<I>Extracted from. a telegram of the Chinese Soviet Government. Dated 6
October 1932</I>]
  <hr class="end" />
<P>
Workers, peasants, and soldiers of all China! Exploited masses of the
whole
country!
<P>
The Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic long
ago
told the popular masses of the whole country that the League of Nations
is
a League of Robbers by which the various imperialisms are dismembering
China.
The principal task of the Lytton Commission of Enquiry sent to China by
the
League was to prepare the dismemberment of China and the repression of
all
the revolutionary movements that have raised the flag of the Chinese
Soviets.
<P>
Now the Commission of Enquiry of the league of imperialist robbers
&#151;
the Lytton Commission &#151; has already published its report regarding
the
dismemberment of China. This report is an admirable document shown to
the
Chinese popular masses by the imperialists regarding the dismemberment
they
propose to inflict on China, and yet the Kuomintang, which is selling
out
and dishonouring the country, as well as the government which is the
emanation
of the Kuomintang, have accepted it completely ! ....
<P>
The Lytton Report is the bill of sale by which imperialism reduced the
Chinese
people to slavery! The Soviet Government calls on the popular masses of
the
whole country to participate in an armed uprising under the direction of
the Soviet Government, to wage a national revolutionary war in order to
tear
to shreds the Lytton Report, and to oppose all the new projects of the
imperialists for dismembering China, repressing the Chinese revolution,
and
attacking the Soviet regions and the Soviet union. Let us hurl out of
China,
Japanese imperialism and all other imperialisms in order to obtain the
complete
liberation and independence of the Chinese people! Let us defend the
Soviet
Union with arms in our hands, let us establish a close alliance between
the
toiling masses of China and of the Soviet Union.
<P>
The Soviet Government proclaims to the workers, peasants, and soldiers
of
the whole country, and to all the exploited popular masses, that if we
really
want to wage national revolutionary war and oppose the dismemberment of
China
by the imperialists, we must first overthrow the reactionary domination
of
the Kuomintang, these scavengers who pick up the scraps of the
imperialist
dismemberment of China, and who are repressing the national war! ....
