  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE ANTI-JAPANESE WAR
</H1>
<p class="title">
December 1942
<P class="information"><em>
[This is a report delivered by Comrade Mao Tse-tung at a conference of senior
cadres of the Shensi-Kansu-Niagsia Border Region. The years 1941 and 1942
were the hardest for the Liberated Areas in the war of Resistance Against
Japan. The savage attacks by the Japanese invaders and the encirclement and
blockade by the Kuomintang created enormous financial difficulties for the
Liberated Areas. Comrade Mao Tse-tung pointed out that in order to overcome
these difficulties it was necessary for the Party to exert itself in leading
the people in developing agriculture and other branches of production, and
he called upon the government and other organizations, the schools and the
army in the Liberated Areas to produce as much as possible for their own
support. Comrade Mao Tse-tung's 'Economic and Financial Problems' and his
articles 'Spread the Campaigns to Reduce Rent, Increase Production and Support
the Government and Cherish the people&#146; in the Base Areas' and 'Get
Organized!' formed the Party's basic programme for leading the production
campaign in the Liberated Areas. Comrade Mao Tse-tung here severely criticizes
the mistaken<B> </B>notion of concentrating on public revenue and expenditure
to the neglect of economic development, and the wrong working style of making
demands on the people without mobilizing and helping them to develop production
and surmount difficulties, and he set forth the Party's correct policy of
"developing the economy and ensuring supplies". With this policy great successes
were achieved in the production campaign which was unfolded in the
Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and in the Liberated Areas behind the
enemy lines. It not only enabled the armed forces and the people of the Liberated
Areas successfully to tide over the most difficult period of the war, but
also provided the Party with a rich store of experience for guiding economic
construction in later years. The first Chapter of this report was published
in the '<I>Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung</I>',

<h4>
  
  1. A BASIC SUMMARY OF OUR PAST WORK
</h4>
<P>
The general policy guiding our economic and financial work is to develop
the economy and ensure supplies. But many of our comrades place one-sided
stress on public finance and do not understand the importance of the economy
as a whole; engrossed in matters of revenue and expenditure as such they
cannot find solutions to any problem hard as they try. The reason is that
an outmoded and conservative notion is doing mischief in their minds. They
do not know that while a good or a bad financial policy affects the economy,
it is the economy that determines finance. Without a well-based economy it
is impossible to solve financial difficulties, and without a growing economy
it is impossible to attain financial sufficiency. The financial problem in
the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region is that of supplying funds for the
living and operating expenses of tens of thousands of troops and civilian
personnel, in other words, the problem of supplying funds for waging the
war. These funds come partly from taxes paid by the people and partly from
production carried on by the tens of thousands of troops and civilian personnel
themselves. We shall simply be resigning ourselves to extinction unless we
develop both the private and the public sectors of the economy. Financial
difficulties can be overcome only by down-to-earth and effective economic
development. To neglect economic development and the opening up of sources
of finance, and instead to hope for the solution of financial difficulties
by curtailing indispensable expenditures, is a conservative notion which
cannot solve any problem.
<P>
In the last five years we have passed through several<B> </B>stages. Our
worst difficulties occurred in 1940 and 1941, when, the Kuomintang created
friction by its two anti-Communist drives. For a time we had a very acute
scarcity of clothing, cooking oil, paper and vegetables, of footwear for
our soldiers and of winter bedding for our civilian personnel. The Kuomintang
tried to strangle us by cutting off the funds due to us and imposing an economic
blockade; we were indeed in dire straits. But we pulled through. Not only
did the people of the Border Region provide us with grain but, in particular,
we resolutely built up the public sector of our economy with our own hands.
The government established many industries to meet the needs of the Border
Region, the troops engaged in an extensive production campaign and expanded
agriculture, industry and commerce to supply their own needs, and the tens
of thousands of people in the various organizations and schools also developed
similar economic activities for their own support. This self-supporting economy,
which has been developed by the troops and the various organizations and
schools, is a special product of the special conditions of today. It would
be unreasonable and incomprehensible in other historical conditions, but
it is perfectly reasonable and necessary at present. It is by such means
that we have been overcoming our difficulties. Do not these indisputable
historical facts prove the truth that supplies can be ensured only through
economic development? While we still face many difficulties, the foundation
of the public sector of our economy has already been laid. In another year,
by the end of 1943, this foundation will be even firmer.
<P>
Developing the economy is the correct line, but development does not mean
reckless or ill-founded expansion. Some comrades who disregard the specific
conditions here and now are setting up an empty clamour for development,
for example, they are demanding the establishment of heavy industry and putting
forward plans for huge salt and armament industries, all<B> </B>of<B> </B>which
are unrealistic and unacceptable. The Party's line is the correct line for
development; it opposes outmoded and conservative notions on the one hand
and grandiose, empty and unrealistic plans on the other. This is the
Party&#146;s struggle on two fronts in financial and economic work.
<P>
While we must develop the public sector of our economy we should not forget
the importance of help from the people. They have given us grain, 90,000
tan in 1940, 200,000 in 1941 and 160,000 in 19421<B>
<SUP>[<A HREF="mswv6_35_10.htm#bn1">1</A>]</SUP></B>, thus ensuring food
for our troops and civilian personnel. Up to the end of 1941, the grain output
of the public sector of our agriculture was meagre and we relied on the people
for grain. We must urge the army to produce more grain, but for a time we
shall still have to rely mainly on the people. Although the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia
Border Region is in the rear and has not suffered direct war damage it has
only 1,500,000 inhabitants, a small population for so large an area, and
the provision of such large quantities of grain is not easy. Besides, the
people transport salt for us or pay a salt transport levy, and in 1941 they
purchased five million <I>yuan</I> worth of government bonds; all of which
represents no small burden. To meet the needs of the War of Resistance and
national reconstruction, the people must shoulder such burdens, the necessity
of which they very well realize. When the government is in very great
difficulties, it is necessary to ask the people to bear a heavier burden,
and they understand that too. But while taking from the people we must at
the same time help them to replenish and expand their economy. That is to
say, appropriate steps and methods must be adopted to help the people develop
their agriculture, animal husbandry, handicrafts, salt industry and commerce,
so that they gain at the same time as they give and, moreover, gain more
than they give; only thus can we sustain a long war against Japan.
<P>
Disregarding the needs of the war, some comrades insist that the government
should adopt a policy of "benevolence". This is a mistake. For unless we
win the war against Japan such "benevolence" will mean nothing to the people
and will benefit only the Japanese imperialists. Conversely, although the
people have to carry rather heavy burdens for the time being, things will
get better for them as the difficulties confronting the government and the
troops are overcome, the War of Resistance is sustained and the enemy is
defeated; and this is where the true benevolence of the revolutionary government
lies.
<P>
Another mistake is "draining the pond to catch the fish", that is, making
endless demands on the people, disregarding their hardships and considering
only the needs of the government and the army. That is a Kuomintang mode
of thinking which we must never adopt. Although we have temporarily added
to the people's burden, we have immediately set to work building the public
sector of our economy. In the years 1941 and 1942 the army, the government
and other organizations and the schools met most of their needs by their
own efforts. This is a wonderful achievement without precedent in Chinese
history, and it contributes to the material basis of our invincibility. The
greater our self-supporting economic activities, the more we shall be able
to lighten the people's tax burdens. In the first stage from 1937 to 1939
we took very little from them; during this stage they were able to build
up considerable strength<B>. </B>In<B> </B>the second stage, from 1940 to
1942, the burden on<B> </B>the people was increased. The third stage will
begin in 1943. In the<B> </B>next two years, 1943 and 1944, if the public
sector of our economy continues to grow and if all or most of our troops
in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region are in a position to engage in
farming, then by the end of 1944 the people's burden will again be lightened,
and they will again be able to build up strength. This is a possibility which
we should prepare to turn into actuality.
<P>
We must refute all one-sided views and advance the correct slogan of our
Party, "Develop the economy and ensure supplies." With regard to the relation
between public and private interests, our slogans are "Give consideration
to both public and private interests" and "Give consideration to both troops
and civilians." We consider only such slogans to be correct. We can guarantee
our financial needs only by expanding both the public and the private sectors
of our economy in a realistic and practical way. Even in difficult times
we must take care to set a limit to taxation so that the burdens, though
heavy, will not hurt the people. And as soon as we can, we should lighten
the burdens so that the people can build up strength.
<P>
The Kuomintang die-hards regard construction in the Border region as a hopeless
undertaking and the difficulties here as insurmountable; they are expecting
the Border Region to collapse any day. It is not worth arguing with such
people; they will never see the day of our "collapse" and we shall unquestionably
grow more and more prosperous. They do not understand that under the leadership
of the Communist Party and the Border Region revolutionary government the
masses always give their support to the Party and government. And the Party
and the government will always find ways to get over economic and financial
difficulties, however serious. In fact we have already pulled through some
of our recent difficulties and will soon overcome others. We encountered
difficulties<B> </B>many times greater in the past and surmounted them all.
With intense fighting going on every day, our base areas in northland and
central China are now facing much greater difficulties than the
Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region, but we have already<B> </B>held out for
five and a half years in these areas and can certainly continue to do so
till victory. For us, there is no ground for pessimism; we can conquer any
difficulty.
<P>
After the present conference of senior cadres of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia
Border Region we shall put into effect the policy of "better troops and simpler
administrations"<B><SUP>[<A HREF="mswv6_35_10.htm#bn2">2</A>]</SUP></B>.
It must be carried out strictly, thoroughly and universally, and not
perfunctorily, superficially, or partially. In carrying it out we must attain
the five objectives of simplification, unification, efficiency, economy and
opposition to bureaucracy. These five objectives have a very important bearing
on our economic and financial work. Simplification will reduce nonproductive
expenditures and increase our income from production, it will not only have
a direct and healthy effect on our finance but will lighten the people's
burdens and benefit them economically. In our economic and financial set-up,
we must overcome such evils as disunity, assertion of independence, lack
of co-ordination, and must establish a working system which is unified and
responsive to direction and which permits the full application of our policies
and regulations. With the establishment of such a unified system working
efficiency will rise. All our organizations, and particularly those engaged
in economic and financial work, must pay attention to thrift. By practicing
thrift we can cut out a great deal of unnecessary and wasteful expenditure,
which amounts possibly to tens of millions of yuan. Finally, people engaged
in economic and financial work must overcome surviving bureaucratic practices,
some of which, such as corruption and graft, over-elaborate organization,
meaningless "standardization" and red tape, are very serious. If we fully
attain these five objectives in the Party the government and the army, our
policy of "better troops and simpler administration" will achieve its purpose,
our difficulties surely be overcome, and we shall silence the gibes about
our approaching "collapse".
<P>
Below, we shall discuss separately various objectives of financial and economic
work, concretely summarize experience in past work, and put forward the general
policies for work that should be carried out in 1943.
