  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE ANTI-JAPANESE WAR
</h1>
<P>
<h4>
  3. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANIMAL HUSBANDRY
</h4>
<P>
The three major subsidiary undertakings of the peasants of the Boarder Region
are animal husbandry, salt transport. and textiles. It is well known that
the breeding of cows and donkeys plays a decisive role in agriculture and
salt transport. The breeding of sheep is closely related to the supply of
bedding and clothing. Last year the peasants of the Border Region harvested
more than 1 million <B><I>jin</I></B> of wool. Including sheep exported the
estimated value was more than 20 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> which is proof
of the importance of sheep. The greatest enemies of livestock are the many
diseases and the lack of fodder. If we do not solve these two problems, there
can be no development. In the first place the destructive power of disease
is very great. For example in the Spring of 1941, more than 20,000 Sheep
died in an epidemic in Jingbian. In 1942 more than 16,000 died at the same
cause in Dingbian. In the summer of 1941, more than 500 cows died of cattle
plague in Yan'an. In the summer and autumn of 1942, 574 cows died in Zhidan.
This shows how disease is the great enemy of the livestock of the Border
Region. Secondly. the lack of fodder also greatly hinders the raising of
livestock. In the spring of 1941 when 20,000 sheep died in Jingbian, most
of the 30,000 lambs also died. Besides the epidemic, an important factor
was the lack of fodder. At the same time over 2,000 cows and horses died
of hunger there. Another keenly-felt difficulty in recent years is the lack
of fodder supplies on salt-transport routes, which greatly hinders the transport
of salt.
<P>
Our task is to protect livestock and increase breeding. In order to attain
these goals we should implement the following policies.
<P>
<I>Prevention of disease.</I> &nbsp;The important thing here is for the county
and district governments to call meetings of local veterinarians and old
experienced peasants to do research into simple methods of preventing and
curing animal diseases, and to encourage the use of these methods among peasant
families with livestock. This is a very simple thing to effect. Secondly,
the Reconstruction Department should order its agricultural station to increase
veterinary equipment, to do research into animal diseases in the Border Region,
to produce large amounts of serum and vaccine, arid to propagate and implement
effective methods of prevention and cure.
<P>
<I>Popularize the planting of grass for animal pasture.</I> &nbsp; Most of
the animals of the Border Region are put out to pasture. Where the pasture
is not good, disease easily arises. Therefore we should widely promote the
planting of alfalfa [<I>musu</I>], particularly on and near the salt-transport
routes. This will benefit both<B> </B>the transport of salt and the development
of animal husbandry. In 1942 the government originally planned to plant 30,000
<B><I>mu</I></B> of alfalfa, but ultimately only 23,000 <B><I>mu</I></B>
were planted because there were not enough seeds. In 1943 the county governments
should transport more seeds from Guanzhong and issue them to the peasants
in areas where planting is planned. They should also encourage the peasants
to buy some themselves. In addition they should mobilize the peasants to
cut large quantities of grass in the autumn and to store it up for winter
use. This will not only avoid illness induced by animals eating cold grass
but also stop the peasants from selling animals because of lack of winter
fodder. We should look to the experience of Jingbian in this respect. Warned
by the great loss of livestock in the spring of 1941, the comrades in Jingbian
have done much work in tine past two years. They have appealed to the peasants
to plant alfalfa, create fields for pasture, cut autumn grass, plant willow
trees, and dig up grass roots as means of providing fodder. First of all
their called upon the peasants to plant over<I> </I>2,000
<B><I>mu</I></B> of alfalfa in 1942. Most of the seed was issued by the
government, and the peasants were very enthusiastic. They are once again
preparing to issue some credit for seeds to the peasants in 1943, and they
are specially calling upon the peasants themselves to prepare seeds. As a
way of encouraging them to plant large amounts of alfalfa, they are giving
rewards to those who do very well. Secondly, they prepared more than 4,000
<B><I>mu</I></B> of pasture fields in 1942. The grass on this pasture land
is mainly reed grass [<I>luwei</I>]. This<I> </I>flourishes in the ponds
and large marshes in the desert land bordering an Mongolia. Each <B><I>mu
</I></B>yields more than 500 <B><I>jin</I></B>. The pasture fields that existed
before the revolution were later destroyed and the cows and sheep wandered
around at will. Now they are mobilizing the masses to restore them. It does
not take a lot of labour, and cutting the grasses after autumn prepares for
winter use. Thirdly, in the mountainous areas of Jingbian there is a lot
of reed grass, white grass <I>[baicao]. </I>bing grass <I>[bingcao], </I>desert
bushes, and so forth. These are of great help for the livestock, if they
are harvested in autumn. In 1941 the masses were organized to gather 5 million
<B><I>jin</I></B>. In 1942 they again mobilized each man to cut 100
<B><I>jin</I></B>. As yet they have not worked out the latter total. Fourthly,
they encouraged the masses to plant willow-trees, sand-willows, and pea-trees.
The leaves and twigs can be fed to camels and sheep which is another way
of providing fodder. At the same time this supplies fuel which pleases the
masses The duty of the government is to supply seeds and encourage planting.
Fifthly, in Jingbian the animals eat both the leaves and the roots of the
white grass and bing grass. During spring ploughing the strongest men in
Jingbian plough the land in the morning, dig-up roots in the afternoons,
and feed the livestock in the evening. The woman and children spend the whole
day digging-up roots. Each person can clean-up more than 100
<B><I>jin</I></B>, and this plays an important part in this supply of fodder.
However, the government must make<I> </I>good<I> </I>arrangements since,
as there are many people digging, there are arguments over land rights. The
landless refugees make it even more difficult. According to the Jingbian
comrades<B>:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  'With these methods we solved many problems for the people. Of course the
  grass grew well in 1942 because there was a good rainfall. However, animal
  husbandry also developed because of the above five methods for providing
  fodder. In 1942 over 60,000 lambs survived throughout the county and there
  were very few deaths. With the exception of a few areas, there was a great
  reduction in the loss through disease of fully-grown sheep, and cows, donkeys,
  horses and so forth. Excluding sheep, the livestock of Jingbian requires
  30 million <B><I>jin</I></B> of fodder per year. We can get at least 10 million
  <B><I>jin</I></B> with the above five methods.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Fodder is a life-and-death question for livestock. We hope that the comrades
in the various counties will make a plan for fodder in 1943.
<P>
<I>Ban the slaughter and export of female animals.</I> &nbsp; The slaughter
of all cattle is forbidden and old cattle can only be killed after inspection.
<P>
<I>Improve animal breeds.</I> &nbsp;We should investigate experience in
cross-breeding, select good breeds of donkeys and sheep, and popularize them
among the people. This should be done first of all in Ganquan and Yan'an
and then spread to other counties. Besides this the government should purchase
<B><I>tanyang</I></B> sheep from Yanchi. These should be issued for breeding
to peasant families with many sheep. Each <B><I>tanyang</I></B> ram can be
mated with twenty<B> </B>ewes. The wool of this sheep is extremely fine and
soft, and each sheep yields 2 <B><I>jin</I></B> per year.
<P>
If we can conscientiously implement the above methods. there can be even
greater expansion of livestock in the Border Region. I hope the Reconstruction
Department and the comrades in the various counties will pay attention to
this.
