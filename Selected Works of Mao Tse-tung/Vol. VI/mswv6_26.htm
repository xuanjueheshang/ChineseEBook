  SPEECH AT THE MEETING CELEBRATING THE COMPLETION OF THE BUILDING OF THE
  ANTI-JAPANESE MILITARY AND POLITICAL UNIVERSITY
</H1><p class="title">
1937<p>
<hr class="end" />
<p>
What I want to say to you, Comrades, is that, in short. the success of this
great enterprise is due to [our] overcoming difficulties and uniting with
the masses. The experience of the struggle in the past ten years. the cave
[-buildings] you have dug, and the future course of the Resistance War have
proved or will prove that if we continue to overcome difficulties and unite
with the masses we shall be ever victorious!
<p>
To overcome natural difficulties by defeating the foes and to overcome military
difficulties by defeating the Japanese bandits have something in common but
quite a lot of differences. The latter is harder and more arduous. Therefore
in addition to orienting oneself towards overcoming difficulties and uniting
with the masses, the Resistance War requires skills in strategy and tactics,
in mobilizing, organizing, and leading the masses, and in winning allies.
<p>
You have now the spirit to overcome difficulties and unite with the masses.
If you can use your talents to develop from this basis, it is entirely possible
to defeat Japan and drive the Japanese out of China.
