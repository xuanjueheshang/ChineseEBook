  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE ANTI-JAPANESE WAR
</h1>
<P>
<h4>
  
  2. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE
</h4>
<P>
The general strategy for economic and financial work in the Border Region
is to develop the economy and ensure supplies. This being the case, the first
and most important questions are<B>: </B> &#145;How has our economic work
been done in the past?&#146;, &#145;What are the successes?', 'What are the
shortcomings?&#146;, and, &#145;What should be our strategy henceforth?'
.
<P>
The economy of the Border Region is divided into the two large sectors, the
public and the private. The private sector of our economy consists of all
agriculture, industry, and commerce undertaken by private individuals. The
public sector of our economy consists of the agriculture, industry, and commerce,
undertaken by the government, troops, official organizations and schools.
The functions and relationship of these two sectors are such that the private
sector provides the livelihood of the 1,400,000 people of the Border Region.
At the same time through taxation, it assists the government and troops,
and supports the sacred cause of the War of Resistance and the reconstruction
of the country. The public sector provides the bulk of the living and operating
expenses of several tens of thousands of Party members, government-workers
and soldiers, thus reducing the amount taken from the people and building
up their resources so that these can be obtained in future urgent need. The
principles used here are 'Give consideration to both public and private
interests' and 'Give consideration to both troops and civilians' .
<P>
If our Party and government do not pay attention to mobilizing the people
and helping them to develop agriculture, industry, and commerce, their life
cannot be improved, and the needs of the War of Resistance cannot be met.
As a result there will be trouble between the troops and the people. And
if we cannot settle the minds of the troops and the people, it is pointless
to consider anything else. Therefore the most important task is for the Party
and the government to concentrate great efforts on building up the people's
economy.
<P>
However, relaying on the taxes handed over by the people alone cannot meet
the needs of the War of Resistance and the reconstruction of the country.
This is particularly true of the Border Region where the area is large and
the population sparse, and where there has long been a large contradiction
between the taxes paid by the people and the expenditure of the government.
Therefore, we must also concentrate great efforts on managing the public
sector of the economy. This is an extremely great responsibility borne by
our government, troops, official organizations and schools. In the past few
years we have had great successes in this work. In 1943 we must achieve even
greater successes so as directly to meet the needs of the War of Resistance
and the reconstruction of the country. The more the public sector of the
economy grows, the more the burden carried by the people can be reduced.
This is another way of building up the resources of the people. And the
instrument which unites and reconciles the private and public sectors is
the currency.
<P>
The Private sector comprises agriculture, animal husbandry, handicrafts,
cooperative undertakings, the salt industry, and commerce. Here I shall first
deal with agriculture.
<P>
The agriculture of the Border Region was depressed during the period of the
land revolution. At that time there was much uncultivated land in Yan'an,
Ansai, Bao&#146;an, Ganquan, Huachi and the three eastern counties, etc.
On the border between Huachi and Bao&#146;an, there was an area called
Erjiachuan, which was more than 200 <I>li</I> long, yet only twenty or thirty
households lived there. As early as the Tongzhi period (1862-74 ) there was
no one living in Wuyasi and Zhangjiacha in Bao&#146;an county. Fucunchuan
in Ganquan county, and Jinpenwan and Machichuan in Yan'an county had for
the most part ceased to be cultivated. Cotton-planting had ceased throughout
the Border region. The decline in animal husbandry was very great. Only
400,000-500, 000 head of sheep remained and 100,000 oxen and donkeys. Textiles,
the transport of salt, and other subsidiary undertakings had all been disrupted
in the same way. In particular the textile industry had almost completely
disappeared. By 1938, only 70,000 packs of eating salt were exported. All
this shows how depressed the agriculture of the Border Region was at that
time. Agriculture was only speedily restored and developed after the Central
Red Army came to the Border Region and civil war ceased, after the local
bandits were cleaned up and the peasants were given security, after the 'left'
economic policy was corrected and a mild taxation policy was adopted, and
after the Party and government's call for the development of agriculture
had greatly raised the enthusiasm of the peasants for production.

<P>
Explanation<B>:</B>
<P>
(1) The statistics for the livestock of Jiaxian and Mizhi counties have not
been included; the 1939 figures for livestock include the 1940 total for
seven of the counties.
<P>
(2) The figure for the area of new land cultivated is for the amount of new
land opened each year. The figures for cotton planted and for livestock are
the annual totals for the whole of the Border Region.
<P>
These statistics show that year by year the cultivated land of the Border
Region has expanded, the acreage of cotton planted has grown, and the amount
of livestock has increased. Moreover. the real totals are more than those
shown in the statistical table. As a result much of the formerly uncultivated
land has become productive. For example, there are now more than a hundred
households in Erjiachuan and all the land of the area has been cultivated.
Wuyasi and Zhangjiacha are now both fully inhabited. In the past, all eleven
districts in Yan'an county had unused land. At preset only Jinpen and Liulin
districts, half the Central district and one township in Yaodian district
have uncultivated land. In 1939, there were only about 300,000 <I>mu</I>
of ploughed land in Yan&#146;an. In 1942, there were 699,538 <I>mu</I>. There
used to be a lot of uncultivated land in the counties of Ansai, Anding, Yanchuan,
and Yanchang. Now there is very little. Before 1940 the Border Region bought
grain from Luochuan county and east of the yellow River. Now, not only, is
it unnecessary to buy grain from outside, there is even some surplus grain
which is exported to the region of Yulin. Some people have moved here from
other areas, livestock has increased, but we do not feel a shortage of grain.
In the light of all these facts there is no longer any doubt that the Border
Region can be self-supporting in grain.
<P>
Cotton-growing has not only again reached its pre-revolutionary peak, but
has also developed. For example, the districts of Yongping, Yongsheng and
Yuju in Yanchuan county did not previously grow cotton. Now they have all
started growing it. The same is true of Yan'an. The profit from cotton is
greater than the profit from grain. The return from 1 <I>mu</I> of cotton
is on average 700 <I>yuan</I> or more, whereas if grain were planted the
return would only be 200 yuan. The ratio is thus 3:1. In 1939, the area planted
to cotton was only just over 3,700 <I>mu</I>. In 1942 it was more than 94,000
<I>mu</I>, and the quantity produced reached 1,400,000 <I>jin</I>. This was
a great achievement. However the amount needed by the Border Region is 3
million <I>jin</I>. This is our future task.
<P>
The increase in livestock has also been very rapid. For example, in 1937
there were only about 8,000 sheep in Yan'an. Now there are more than 60,000.
In 1937 there were only 70,000 sheep in Huachi, now there are more than 120,000.
Before the land revolution, there were only five flocks of sheep in Zhangjiahe
of Third township, Dongyang district, Yanchuan county. (There was no grazing
land and there could only be thirty to fifty head in each flock. ) Now there
are thirteen flocks. Oxen and donkeys have increased by almost two-thirds
since the time of the civil war. As a result in 1940 and 1941 we were able
to export 500,000 packs of salt. If it were not for the increase in oxen
and donkeys, this salt would have been very difficult to move out.
<P>
However, the development of agriculture has not been even Those areas with
relatively all-round development and rather more successes include the counties
under direct administration and the Longdong sub-region, in particular Yan'an,
Ansai, Ganquan, Huachi, Quzi and the three eastern counties. This is because
they have a lot of land, few people, and the climate is quite good. These
counties also have the biggest share in the subsidiary work of salt transport
and at the same time, the largest amount of public expenditure. The area
that has not developed is the special military area [Jingbeiqu], because
it has a large population and the land is limited. There is no possibility
of enlarging the ploughed area. They have had some success there in the gradual
restoration of household spinning and weaving work. Moreover, there has been
some emigration to the Yan'an area, which has eased the distribution of
population and land.
<P>
The speed of development has also varied. Development was faster before 1940,
particularly in the years 1939 and 1940. In these two years 1,700,000
<I>mu</I> of new land were opened up. In 1940, the number of sheep increased
by nearly 600,000, and oxen and donkeys by over 50,000. But in 1941 and 1942
only about 600,000 <I>mu</I> of land were opened up. This is only one-third
of the previous two years. There were fewer sheep in 1941 over 1940, and
the number of oxen and donkeys only increased by 10,000 (in reality there
was a reduction). However, in these two years cotton-growing and textiles
both developed.
<P>
The above outlines the development of agriculture in the Border Region. Now
I want to say a few words about how this development took place.
<P>
Before the civil war ended, agriculture was in decline. Afterwards it developed.
How did this development come about? Apart from the arrival of the Central
Red Army, the cleaning up of the local bandits, and the realization of peace
so that the peasants could live and work securely, there were the following
six reasons.
<P>
(1) The 'left' mistakes in economic policy were corrected and the policies
to build up the resources of the people were implemented. Although the peasants
had obtained a share of land, they were afraid to develop production because
of the 'left' economic policy. In addition, because agriculture was disrupted
both before and after the revolution, the base was very weak and hindered
growth. The Central Committee corrected the left policy and thus put an end
to the peasants' tendency to fear developing production. The peasants were
then willing to buy more implements, and the rich peasants dared to take
on tenants [an huozi] and long-term labourers [au changgong]. The milder
policies restored confidence and helped the extension of production. At the
same time the high price for grain and the great profit in subsidiary
undertakings stimulated the peasants' zeal to produce, and made agriculture
develop rapidly. This laid the basis for the levy of 200,000 <I>tan</I> of
grain tax and 26 million <I>jin</I> of hay tax in 1941.
<P>
(2) Calls were made for the development of production. The Production
Mobilization Conference for cadres held by the Central Committee (1939),
the Second Party Congress of the Border Region (1939), the first meeting
of the Border Region Council (1941) and the first agricultural exhibition,
all called for the development of production. These calls played a major
role in promoting growth. They first aroused the cadres, and then through
them penetrated deeply to the masses, mobilizing men, women, old, young,
and even loafers [er liuzi] to take part in production. They increased the
labour force, and finally destroyed the peasants' fear of developing production.
Thus the amount of new land opened up in 1939 was more than 1 million
<I>mu</I>, and real imports of livestock were also greatest in that year.
<P>
(3) The immigration policy. A major reason for the enlargement of cultivated
land by 2,350,000 <B><I>mu</I></B> in the past four years has been that those
regions with large amounts of land have absorbed large numbers of immigrants,
and increased their population. For example, in 1937 Yan'an (including
Yan&#146;an city) only had a population of 34,000. Now its population is
roughly 70,000. Because of this, cultivated land in this county has increased
from around 300,000 <I>mu</I> to roughly 700,000 <I>mu</I>. In 1936 Ansai
only had a population of about 20,000. Now it has a population of more than
40,000. Ganquan originally had about 8,000 people. Now it has more than 14,000.
In 1938 Yanchang only had a population of 25,000. Now it has more than 32,000.
Yanchuan had the least amount of uncultivated land, but between 1938 and
the present its population has increased by over 10,000. Huachi only had
a population of 35,000 in 1938. Now it has a population of more than 40,000.
Other places such as Bao&#146;an, Anding, Jingbian, and the counties of the
Longdong and Guanzhong sub-regions have also increased their population.
These immigrants came mostly from Hengshan, Yulin, Shenmu, and Fugu, and
secondly from the special military area. They all came voluntarily and were
not organized by the government, They were willing to come because there
was land and they were treated well. The various counties organized the existing
householders to give help with grain tools, and cave houses, etc. At the
same time the rich peasants took on tenants, which also helped the immigrants.
The increase in immigrants not only enlarged the area cultivated, but also
increased livestock, and stimulated commerce. Therefore the immigrants were
one of the factors in the development of agriculture.
<P>
(4) The policy of incentives. Immigrants do not pay grain tax for three years,
and their other obligations are reduced. If some of the peasants&#146; planting
cotton do not make as much profit as those planting grain, the government
pays compensation. If livestock is purchased from outside the Border Region,
there is a reduction in grain tax by a fixed amount in the first year. In
addition, there were the rewards to labour heroes given at the two agricultural
exhibitions, which also brought about great results. For example, Wu Manyou
and Mao Kehu of Yan&#146;an and Due Fafu of Ganquan were rewarded at the
first agricultural exhibition. Now they have become very good, rich peasants.
They all pay more than 5 <I>tan</I> of grain tax (in the Border Region 1
<I>tan</I> is 300 <I>jin</I>). Moreover, they have encouraged other peasant
householders in the villages to develop production. All these things have
promoted the development of agriculture, in particular of grain and cotton.
<P>
(5) The reduction in the wastage of labour power, and the better adjustment
in the use of labour power. Because we were busy fighting during the civil-war
period, we did not pay attention to production and the land was neglected.
After peace was established, there were frequent exercises and guard duties
by the self-defence army [ziweijun] and many kinds of meetings. Therefore,
each month each able-bodied man missed at least three working-days. Later
this kind of wastage was reduced. Furthermore, before 1941 not much grain
tax was collected, there was little tax grain transport duty, and the amount
of work missed was comparatively limited. In recent years in rural areas,
contract-labour teams [zhagong] and exchange-labour teams [biangong] have
developed and made better adjustment in the use of labour power. We have
mobilized loafers to take part in production. The number of women joining-in
production has also increased. All these things have helped the development
of Border Region agriculture.
<P>
(6) The policy of agricultural credit. Formerly there was no agricultural
credit but this was offset by the mild taxation policy. Now that grain tax
has increased and particularly as 80 per-cent of peasant households must
pay it, those households (roughly one-third) lacking oxen, agricultural,
tools, and food grain must be helped with credit. Moreover, a supply of credit
is very necessary for certain kinds of agriculture that must be developed
(like cotton-planting), for agricultural subsidiaries (like spinning and
weaving), and for certain regions which need more development. Although only
4 million <I>yuan</I><B> </B>credit was given in 1942, of which merely 1,500,000
<I>yuan</I><B> </B>was for oxen, over 2,600 oxen and nearly 5,000 agriculture
implements were bought and cotton-planting also expanded. It cannot be denied
that this was a great help. But because finances are limited and we can only
lend according to the government's financial strength, we still cannot provide
enough credit to match the needs of the peasant households. However, a little
is always better than nothing, and it does give some help.
<P>
The above are several of the major factors in the development of agriculture;
below I shall discuss several major lessons to be drawn from our work.
<P>
(1) Act according to the conditions of the area and the season. Agricultural
regions and seasons are different and methods of development are also different.
For example, there is no uncultivated land in the special military area (apart
from a small amount in Qingjian). The cultivated land area cannot be enlarged.
Sheep-herding is limited by the pasture lands available. There is also a
lack of pack-animals for the transport of salt. The policy of rent reduction
has not yet been thoroughly implemented. Because of these things, grain
production has not increased in those areas, and with the exception of spinning
and weaving, subsidiary undertakings have not developed. Although improved
techniques such as more frequent hoeing of weeds, greater use of manure,
and more deep ploughing were introduced there long ago, we should still carry
out more investigation of the situation, and at the right time do our utmost
to increase production. However, if we were to employ these improved techniques
in areas where land is plentiful population sparse, and working methods
primitive, they would not be very effective because they all need an increase
in labour power. From the point of view of the peasants of the latter kind
of area, deep ploughing is not as good as planting more land. Applying more
manure is not as good as opening up more uncultivated land. Planting more
land is especially good in areas with low rainfall. Therefore, in these areas
the call to improve agricultural methods is in general ineffective at the
present time. To really increase production in these regions the most important
thing for the moment is to rely on opening up unused land. If in the six
years from 1937 to 1942 the increase in ploughed land was roughly 3 million
<I>mu</I> then the amount harvested in 1942 was at least 500,000 <I>tan</I>
more than in 1936, which is equivalent to 250,000 <I>tan</I> of hulled grain
(each <I>tan</I> is 300 <I>jin</I>). If we estimate the grain production
of the Border Region in 1942 to be 1,500,000 <I>tan</I> of hulled grain,
then over six years, the increase in grain production through the increase
of ploughed land is approximately one-sixth of the total. Some of this increase
in cultivated land is new land opened up by immigrants, and some is expansion
of land farmed by the original households. All this shows us that in directing
agriculture, we must adopt different methods in different regions. In one
region we should make deep ploughing the key, and in another enlarging the
area ploughed. We must also make distinctions with respect to timing. At
a time when there is unused land that can be cultivated, we should mainly
encourage the opening up of new land. When uncultivated land has been exhausted,
then we must turn to encouraging deep ploughing. We must not only make these
distinctions between large regions, we must also make them within a county,
a district and sometimes even within a township. For example, if certain
villages in a township have rather a lot of unused land, we should encourage
the opening up of unused land there. If in other villages there is little
or no unused land, we should encourage deep ploughing. While there is still
uncultivated land in a township, we should encourage the opening up of land.
When all the lands have been opened up, we should encourage deep ploughing.
Although we have had some successes in the past few years in our work, much
has been too empty and generalized. Many of our comrades still do not know
how to investigate objective circumstances minutely, nor do they know how
to put forward concrete proposals to provide the conditions for increasing
production in different regions, and, at different times. Slogans put forward
in the past for deep ploughing, opening new lands, water conservancy, and
increasing production by 400,000 <I>tan</I> or 200,000 <I>tan</I>, in reality
contained much subjectivism. Many peasants were not interested or influenced
by them. From this we may conclude that in future we must carry out deep,
factual investigation, and solve problems in terms of concrete times, places,
and conditions.
<P>
(2) As yet the peasants in a large number of areas still pay heavy rents
and heavy interest rates, and the policy of reducing these has not been
thoroughly implemented. On the one hand peasants must bear the burden of
paying rent and interest to the landlords, and on the other they must pay
grain tax and money tax to the government. They get too little for themselves,
which dampens their enthusiasm to produce. Thus there is no possibility of
increasing production. From this we may conclude that we must conscientiously
implement the decrees to reduce rent and interest rates.
<P>
(3) As a result of the increase in Braid tax, and the newly levied hay tax,
sheep tax, and salt-transport requirement, the peasants' enthusiasm for
production has diminished. In the two years 1941 and 1942 the peasants paid
a large amount of grain tax, hay tax and salt tax, and during these years
they expanded the area of ploughed land by only 600, 000 <I>mu</I>, merely
60 per cent of the increase in 1939. Livestock did not increase in 1941,
and sheep even declined (of course epidemics had some effect). Immigration
also dropped. In 1942 only 4, 843, households came. Moreover, 3,527 old
households moved out, the reason mainly being that they feared further burdens.
Another reason was that the amount of grain tax collected increased progressively
according to the amount harvested and not according to the area of land worked.
This method, although rational in terms of sharing the burden equally, hindered
the growth of investment in agriculture. It lowered the peasants' enthusiasm
to invest in the land because for the same land a good harvest meant paying
out a lot and a poor harvest meant paying out little or even nothing. If
taxation was based on the area of land worked, this point could be corrected.
The enthusiasm of the middle and rich peasants could be raised, and there
would be no detriment to the poor peasants. From this we may conclude that
there must be limits to the grain tax and hay tax, and at the same time we
must improve the methods of taxation so as to promote agricultural production.
<P>
(4) Policies should be thoroughly implemented. For example, we stipulated
that for three years we would not take grain tax from new immigrants or from
those planting cotton, but in fact we have 'welcomed' grain tax from immigrants,
and we have levied one-half of the grain tax for land planted to cotton.
We originally stipulated that when livestock was bought from areas outside
the Border Region we would reduce grain tax by a definite amount for the
first year, but this has also not yet been implemented. In addition regulations
for giving rewards for increased production have not been fully carried out.
All these things not only affect the authority of the government but also
diminish the enthusiasm of the peasants. From this we may conclude that
henceforward everything pertaining to the decrees announced by the government
must be resolutely implemented.
<P>
(5) More equitable adjustment in the use of labour power and other methods
helpful to peasants, such as exchange-labour teams, contract-labour teams
and so forth, have a strong influence on agricultural growth. However, with
the exception of some counties like Yan'an, we have still not done enough
to organize and promote them. There are certainly many comrades among the
county cadres who are actively striving to put ideas to the people, and who
have originated many good methods for mobilizing the masses to develop
production. They have created many model examples. However, many other comrades
are not like this. They lack the spirit of factual investigation and enthusiastic
effort. They lack creativity. They feel that there is no work that they can
do for agriculture, or they do not know how to set-to. Therefore they only
raise empty slogans like 'spring ploughing' or 'autumn harvest'. They remain
passive, and let the peasants do things as they like. The government simply
keeps a record of what is done. But in fact there are many things to be done.
Many good methods can be thought up. For example, during spring ploughing
in 1942 some of the peasants in Yan'an felt very discouraged. Instances of
moving out, splitting up the family, and selling livestock in preparation
for reducing production occurred. From the point of view of the comrades
who lack enthusiasm and creativity, these phenomena would be insoluble and
it would be best to accept fate and let such bad things happen. But the comrades
from Yan'an were not like this. They were neither passive nor bureaucratic
They were able to grasp the key to the problem and adopt active methods.
They overcame the difficulties. At that time, the Party and government did
much propaganda work, and gave help with grain, cave houses, and agricultural
tools. Afterwards not only did production not decline, but cultivated land
increase by 80,000 <B><I>mu</I></B>. This example proved that there is much
work in agriculture that ran and should be done by the local Party committees
and the local government. Moreover, so long as they<B> </B>grasp the key
points and find a method, then when they act they can be effective. From
this we may conclude that cadres must be active to overcome difficulties,
they must unite with the masses, and according to the needs of the masses
create vigorous methods to solve their problems. They definitely cannot be
passive and bureaucratic.
<P>
In order to give our comrades a clear-cut standpoint on this extremely important
question of uniting closely with the masses and conscientiously solving their
difficulties, I here specially reproduce for reference the reports of the
comrades of Yan'an county on how they handled the problem of opening up unused
land, how they handled the problem of refugees, and how they handled the
problem of loafers.
<P>
What follows is the original report.
<h4>
  
  HOW WAS YAN'AN COUNTY'S PLAN TO OPEN UP 80,000 <I>MU</I> OF UNUSED LAND IN
  1942 COMPLETED?
</h4>
<P>
(1) We relied on the labour power of immigrant refugees to open up uncultivated
land.
<P>
There were 25,428 refugees in the period of 1940 to 1942. On the basis of
five of them equalling one labour power, there were 5,086 labour powers.
Each labour power can open up 10 <B><I>mu</I></B> of new land in one year,
giving a total of 50,860 <B><I>mu</I></B>. (Ten <B><I>mu</I></B> is the average
figure for the land opened up by refugees in the past three years. In 1942
the land opened up by each labour power was more than this. )
<P>
(2) We relied on the labour power of original households and animals to open
up unused land, totaling 29,399 <B><I>mu</I></B>.
<P>
The original households had 10,616 labour powers. The work could be done
with each labour power opening up less than 3 <B><I>mu</I></B>.
<P>
(3) However, the organization of labour power is a major task. This year
we adopted methods of collective labour, such as contract-labour teams and
exchange-labour teams. We also<B> </B>organized women and loafers to take
part in production.
<P>
Altogether we organized 487 contract-labour teams. We also drew 4,939 good
labour powers into collective labour (exchange-labour teams). This was almost
one-third of the total number of labour powers (according to statistics for
this spring, there were 15,702 labour powers in the whole county), which
meant that out of every three people one took part in collective labour.
The method of Contract labour was to form a group of eight to ten good workers
from a village and establish a foreman [gongtou]. Then they opened up new
land and hoed weeds either for themselves or for others. Sometimes the foreman
took part in physical labour, in which case he received pay valued at two
labour days per day worked. If he did not take part, he only received pay
valued at one labour day per day. Those forming contract-labour teams were
either entirely from the local village, or came from outside, or were organized
with people from outside the village together with peasant from the village.
<P>
The peasants were very pleased that we organized loafers to take part in
production. It increased their enthusiasm for work.
<P>
More and more women joined in production each year. In particular refugee
women took part in opening up uncultivated land, and even more of them in
hoeing. There were thirty-nine in Liulin district this year. The refugee
women of Third township in Chuankou district did not have any hoes. They
went to the mountains and waited until others were tired and resting, then
they took up the hoes and began opening-up land. When the others had finished
their rest they handed back the hoes and waited again.
<P>
(4) We relied on production plans for each peasant household. In 1942, this
county laid emphasis on determining production plans for each peasant household
based on discussions with that household and with its agreement. The government
printed a standard form to record plans including such things as opening
up new lands, hoeing weeds, and so forth. When a plan was determined, it
was posted up in the home of each family so that afterwards the government
could examine the production plan of each household according to the form.
When determining peasant household plans we had to pay attention to the following
points<B>:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  i) The production circumstances of the previous year.
  <P>
  ii) The conditions for the increase of production in the current year.
  <P>
  iii) The amount of labour power (human and animal).
  <P>
  iv) Obtaining the agreement of the man concerned.
  <P>
  v) The need for constant examination and supervision of work.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
(5) The effect of agricultural credit was important, in particular the 100,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> credit given to refugees for agricultural tools. When
the refugees arrived they did not have a thing. To open up unused land, first
a mattock was needed to clear away the scrub and then a hoe to break the
land. After agricultural credit was issued and the problem of tools was solved
the refugees' desire to open up new land was very strong. In six days they
were able to open up 3 <B><I>mu</I></B>. In 1942 agricultural credit was
given rather late. The earlier credit is given the sooner more land can be
opened up. (Note: do not violate the agricultural season.)
<P>
(6) During spring ploughing, mobilization work had to be reduced as much
as possible. The peasants were allowed the time to open up new land and to
take part in production.
<P>
(7) The government had a tight grasp on the work of opening-up unused land.
Only three months were available for this. With a hundred-day plan, each
day opening up 800 <B><I>mu</I></B>, it was necessary to have a labour force
of 1,600. This was one-tenth of the laborer force of the whole county. By
19 April we had only opened up 15,000 <B><I>mu</I></B>. This was still far
short of completing the task, and already two-thirds of the time had gone.
Therefore beginning on 20 April, after a rainfall, there was a twenty-day
assault. In the twenty days more than 50 per cent of the whole task was
completed. Between 10 March and 19 April, 15,000 <B><I>mu</I></B> of land
was opened up. This was 18.7 per cent of the work. In the twenty day assault,
46,442 <B><I>mu</I></B> of land was opened up, which was 58 per cent of the
work.
<P>
In the assault the best districts were the following<B>:</B>
<P>
Luilin district<B>:</B> the ratio of new land opened up during the period
of assault to that opened up before was 1,294.4<B>:</B>100.
<P>
Yaodian district<B>:</B> the ratio was 1,184.4<B>:</B>100.
<P>
Chuankou district<B>:</B> the ratio was 432.1<B>:</B>100.
<P>
Altogether the county government held two meetings of district heads to inspect
the work, and issued three directives. The cadres of the county government
went down to the districts and townships more than three times.
<P>
The districts checked up on the work of the townships up to seven or eight
times in some cases, and three times at the very least. The townships also
checked up many times on the work of the villages.
<P>
The tight grasp of the leadership and the strict check-ups played a decisive
role in the completion of the task.

  HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF REFUGEES TAKING PART IN PRODUCTION
</h4>
<P>
&nbsp; (1) [Table 1.2 refers to] Statistics on the flow of refugees into
Yan'an county in recent years.
<P>
Putting it simply, the number of households more than doubled, and the number
of people just about doubled.
<P>
The refugees who came settled mainly in Chuankou, Liulin, Jinpen. and Yaodian
districts. In these districts there was a lot of unused land.

privately-owned unused land did not open it up, we let refugees do so. The
three-year exemption from tax was an incentive.

Notes:
<P>
(a) In 1942, 13,555 <B><I>jin</I></B> of sweet potatoes [yangyu] were given
up the refugees in addition, and on 273 occasions they were helped with oxen.
<P>
(b) Agricultural tools were ploughshares, rakes and hoes.
<P>
(ii ) The problem of a place to live. In the beginning they lived in old
cave houses or broken-down cave houses. Many of the others who came afterwards
were joining friends, relatives, or people of other social relationships.
They lived in the cave houses of those friends or relatives. Having settled
down, they dug out their own cave house. In other cases one person came in
the first year and dug out the cave house. In second year the family came
and moved into the house.
<P>
(iii) We made arrangements among the peasants for grain to eat. We proposed
that if 1 <B><I>tou</I></B> of grain was borrowed before spring, after autumn
1 <B><I>tou</I></B> and 3 <B><I>sheng</I></B> should be repaid. This was
a profit of 30 per cent. It encouraged the original households to lend grain
and the government guaranteed repayment. Another method was to urge the original
households to hire help [diao<B> </B>fenzi], to take on share-cropping tenants
[an zhuangjia] and to contract short-term labour [lan gong] from among the
refugees. Conditions were decided voluntarily by both sides. Allowing<B>
</B>the original households to exploit a little was not a problem because
when the refugees first came they did not have a thing. Although they were
exploited, we could not let them starve.
<P>
Statistics for this year (1942) [are shown in Table 1.4].

  </TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>
These households relied on their employers for food grain. However, the hired
helpers [diao fenzi] could only get supplies for themselves. Hired farmhands
and short-term contract labourers were able to get food grain for their family
members as well. There were 650 households of the latter kind. At a rate
of three people per household, this was altogether 1,950 persons. If we add
on the 359 hired helpers, the full total was 2,309 people relaying on their
employers for grain. If they had asked for aid from the government, at a
rate of 5 <B><I>tou</I></B> per man per year the amount of grain needed would
have been 1,154.5 <B><I>tou</I></B>. What a large amount this would have
been! Therefore on the basis of mutual agreement between employer and employee,
the hiring of farmhands, helpers, and short-term contract labourers solved
many great problems. It not only solved the problem of food grains. It also
enlarged production and increased the supply of grain. Taking each household
as one labour power, there were 1,009 labour powers altogether. One labour
power could produce 2<B> <I>tan</I> </B>of grain, so in total they could
increase grain production by 2,018 <B><I>tan</I></B>. After consumption this
still left a surplus of 863.5<B> <I>tan</I></B>. By the following year these
people were in a position to carry out production by themselves.
<P>
(iv ) The peasants were urged to help the refugees with<B> </B>seed and land
to work. Seed was repaid after autumn, and a rent paid for land with the
government as guarantor.
<P>
(v) The institution of credit for agricultural implements for refugees was
very effective in solving the problem of supplying tools to open up new lands.
If arrangements for any problem (food grain, supply of agricultural implements,
etc.) were not<B> </B>good, the opening up of unused lands could have been
impeded. Therefore it was necessary to solve each problem rapidly and at
the correct time. A delay of one day reduces the amount of land opened up.
<P>
(vi) As for the problem of burdens on the refugees, we resolutely carried
out the decisions of the government of the Border Region on treating them
well. For three years we made no<B> </B>demands on them, and instead the
government helped them solve all kinds of difficulties. This year the government
cadres of the county, districts, and townships saved 10 <B><I>tan</I></B>
of grain for issue to the refugees. While solving the problem of grain for
refugees to eat, Third township in Central district made great efforts to
reduce their burdens.
<P>
(4) Why did the refugees want to come to Yan'an?
<P>
(i) We have really solved the difficulties of referees. The solution of the
refugee food-grain problem in 1940 had a particularly wide influence. In
Chuankou district alone 300 <B><I>tan</I></B> of grain was supplied. Therefore
many more refugees came in the year 1941.
<P>
(ii) Although government calls had a great impact, the effect<B> </B>of the
refugees themselves telling their own friends, relations and other social
acquaintances of the good treatment they received was even greater. We found
that very few refugees who came to us had refugee certificates issued by
Suide sub-region. This was because they feared that after having accepted
settling-in funds or registration cards from there, they would not be free
or they would become public property. They preferred to get money through
their own personal relationships.
<P>
(5) Opinions concerning future immigrant refugees<B>:</B>
<P>
(i) Get more to come by encouraging refugees to use their social connections.
<P>
(ii) The government at county and district levels should conscientiously
solve problems for them.
<P>
(iii) The government of the Border Region should issue some grain and funds
to help them, with repayment after autumn.
<P>
(iv) Persist in carrying out the decisions to treat refugees favourably.

<P>
Note:
<P>
The chief reason for the increase in loafers in 1942 was that in 1941 Jinpenwan
was taken from Gulin county and placed under the administration of this county.
According to statistics, that district had forty-three idlers.
<P>
(i) In Panlong district, a certain spirit medium beat his 'three mountains'
knife<B><SUP>[<A HREF="mswv6_35_10.htm#bn3">3</A>]</SUP></B> into a hoe.
He told the masses he would not swindle people again and would work hard
in future.
<P>
(ii) At Lijiaqu in Third township of Chuankou district, Hui San and Gao Wu
were each given the task of opening up 6 <B><I>mu</I></B> of uncultivated
land this spring. They completed this and even exceeded it by 2
<B><I>mu</I></B>. At Tianujiagelao in Fourth township, Yang Yingcheng was
given the job of opening up 6 <B><I>mu</I></B>. He opened up 9
<B><I>mu</I></B>.
<P>
(iii) In Liulin district this year, seven men were reformed and joined in
production. In Wuyang district twelve men were investigated. After a struggle,
nine of them took part in production. In Fengfu district there were eight
men. At Ganguyi in Yaodian district eight men were organized in two groups
to go to Zhangjiakou to open up new land.
<P>
(iv) At Nanyigou of Third township in Fengfu district, Bai Fenyu was a shaman
before 1936. By 1941 he had an ox and hired a man. He had 200 sheep and had
become the village head. He paid 10.2 <B><I>tan</I></B> grain tax, 200
<B><I>jin</I></B> salt tax, and 50(1 jin hay tax. This year he has got another
ox and hired a helper. He has expanded production and his prospects are very
good.
<P>
(v) Because the government mobilized them to take part in production, the
loafers of Panlong district said: 'If things go wrong this year government
men will be even more strict with us'. For example, Li Dejin from Lijiabian
in Fourth township used to smoke opium. This year he has opened up 6
<B><I>mu</I></B> of new land and also stopped smoking. In the whole district
there were twenty-seven loafers. They have written guarantees that they will
do well in production, and as a result twenty of them are very good.
<P>
(vi) At Liujiaping in Mudan district there is a man (name unknown) with extremely
bright prospects now that the government has mobilized him to join-in production.
Later he sought out one of the government personnel and treated him very
w ell saying "The government was right to get us to take part in production'.
Gao Yucheng from the same district used to be a It at en He did not farm
and he did not cut firewood. Winter and summer, wearing a ragged old
cotton-padded jacket he would curl up on the cold Rang. Each day he would
smoke one-fifth of an ounce [er qian] of opium. His wife and children cried
from cold and hunger. After the revolution and educated by the government,
he has become the production director of Fourth township. Everybody praises
his method of work. He is a labour hero. Moreover he keeps a close watch
on loafers. He forces then to make production plans. Every five days he goes
up into the hills to supervise them. Under his direction Liu Guai and Yan
Fenghe have each planted 24 <I>mu</I> of land this year.
<P>
(2) Our methods of mobilization are<B>:</B>
<P>
(i) Doing propaganda, educational, and persuasive work to get them to take
part in production. Having got some grain in their prospects improve.
<P>
(ii) The government gives them definite production tasks, such as opening
up uncultivated land (see examples above) . They are inspected at regular
intervals. Moreover special people in the villages are designated to supervise
their production.
<P>
(iii) Urging the masses to struggle against them, and to force them to join
production. This year in the two villages, Jinpenhe and Yunshansi in Third
township, Panlong district, production competitions were organized. In this
situation, Chang Degong, a loafer in Jinpenhe, was forced by the villagers
to go up into the hills to open up new land. He has opened up 3 <I>mu</I>.
At the moment he is preparing to plant 15 <I>mu</I>.
<P>
(iv) Organizing the loafers in collective labour. The loafers are concentrated
in the district town and organized into tea. Is to open up new land. After
they Bet rid of the opium-smoking habit, they can go home. The land opened
up and farmed is given to whoever does the work.
<P>
(v) The government solved some of the loafers' production difficulties.
<P>
(3) Results.
<P>
The masses were very pleased that the government made the loafers take part
in production. The masses opposed them very much because they did no work
at all, paid no grain tax, and caused trouble every time there was mobilization
work. As for the loafers themselves, after they obtained some real results
from production, they realized that the government was acting for their
betterment. The above examples clarify this point. As for those who were
extremely stubborn and refused to change, some even running away when the
government tried to mobilize them, on their return they joined in a little
light productive labour. In this county no loafers have become bandits.
<P>
We have not referred to this report of the leading comrades of the Party
and government of Yan'an county without purpose. The spirit of the comrades
of Yan'an county is entirely the spirit of Bolsheviks. Their attitude is
enthusiastic, and there is not the slightest passivity in their thoughts
and in their actions. They are not at all afraid of difficulties, and are
able vigorously and firmly to overcome them all. Look how responsible they
are towards their work: 'In 1942 agricultural credit was given rather late.
The earlier credit is given the sooner more land can be opened up!' 'It was
a necessary to solve each problem rapidly and at the correct time: A delay
of one day reduces the amount of land opened up!' 'Determine the production
plans of each peasant household.' 'The tight grasp of the leadership and
the strict check-ups played a decisive role in the completion of the task.'
How vastly different and hoar much better is this spirit than that of those
timid people who draw back, full of sighs when they meet difficulties, and
of those who are not conscientious in their work and try to get by and neglect
things! Imbued with such spirit, there is not one thing that the comrades
of Yantan did not handle realistically and practically. They have a full
understanding of the feelings, needs, and concrete circumstances of all the
people of Yan'an county. They are completely united with the masses. They
carry out extremely good investigation and research, and thus they have learned
the Marxist art of leading the massed. They are entirely without subjectivism,
sectarianism, and the Party 'eight-legged essay'. How does this compare with
those subjectivists who do not solve problems according to the demands of
the masses but according to their own subjective imagination? And with those
bureaucrats who do no investigation and research work at all end, though
they work for many years, have no idea of whet is going on beneath them?
In there not a world of difference between them? We hope all the comrades
of the Border Region will have this spirit of the comrades of Yan'an, this
attitude towards their work, this one-ness with the masses, this willingness
to carry out investigation work, and thus also learn the Marxist art of leading
the masses to overcome difficulties so as to make our work successful whatever
is undertaken. Quite a few of the comrades of the various counties of the
Border Region are like or more or less like the comrades of Yan'an. We hope
that the model experience of these comrades can quickly spread to all counties,
districts, and townships.
<P>
The above is a summary of agricultural work in the Border Region in the past.
What follows are the tasks for the year 1943.
<P>
The major demand on agriculture is to increase the production of grain and
cotton (subsidiary undertakings will be discussed elsewhere). In the light
of the present need for grain and cotton and also in order to strive for
some grain and cotton for export it is still necessary for us to mobilize
the peasant masses to increase the production of hulled grain by 200,000
<I>tan</I> and to increase the production of cotton by 1,600,000 <I>jin</I>.
Is there any hope that this can be achieved? In the six years between 1937
and 1942, it is estimated that roughly 3 million <I>mu</I> of uncultivated
land was opened up and the production of grain increased by 500,000
<I>tan</I>. Well then, is it possible in the next few years once again on
the basis of opening up new land and other methods to increase the production
of grain by 400, 000 tan equivalent to 200, 000 <I>tan</I> of hulled grain?
In the years between 1939 and 1942 the land planted to cotton exceeded 90,000
<I>mu</I> and the raw cotton produced reached 1,100,000 <I>jin</I>. Well
then in the next few years is it possible to increase the land planted to
cotton by more than 100, 000 <I>mu</I>, and the cotton produced by more than,
60,000 <I>jin</I>?
<P>
We consider that all this is entirely possible.
<P>
If the peasants are able to increase the production of hulled grain by 20,000
<I>tan</I> then even if they hand over 200,000 <B><I>tan</I></B> of grain
tax as in 1941, they will still only have to give the government the amount
of increase. They themselves will be able to keep an amount equal to the
entire previous harvest. As for cotton, even if in future we levy some in
tax, the peasants will still be able to keep the largest part of the harvest,
and e problem of cotton cloth supply for the Border Region can be solved.
<P>
What are the policies which will effectively attain the above targets and
not remain just empty words? According to our past experience the following
eight policies must be implemented: (1) the reduction of rent and the reduction
of interest rates, (2) an increase in the opening up of uncultivated land,
(3) an increase in the planting of cotton; (4) not violating the agricultural
seasons; (5) better adjustment in the use of labour power: (6) an increase
in agricultural credit; (7) improvement in technical skill; (8) implementing
progressive taxation. In what follows I shall deal with each of these eight
points separately.
<P>
Our first agricultural policy is the reduction of rent and the reduction
of interest rates. Approximately one-half of the 1,400,000 people of the
Border Region have received a share of land. The remainder have not yet done
so, such as those in the Suide-Mizhi special military area, Longdong sub-region,
Fuxian county and many places in Sanbian sub-region and so forth. In these
regions we should carry out the reduction of rent and interest rates in
accordance with government decrees. This is an extremely important policy
for increasing the peasants' enthusiasm for production. After rent and interest
rates have been reduced, the peasants' burdens from the landlords are less
and the amount they can keep themselves is increased. Thus their enthusiasm
for production is greatly raised and they can produce more. The Northwest
Bureau [Xibei Ju] has already made concrete arrangements with the Border
Region Government over this policy and I will not speak more of it here.
<P>
Our second agricultural policy is to increase the amount of uncultivated
land opened up. Peasants in areas where there is a lot of uncultivated land
consider that deep ploughing is not as good as opening up new land. We should
therefore organize the peasants in the counties, districts, and townships
where such land exists to develop it as a means of increasing the production
of grain. Besides land freshly cultivated by the original households, we
must mainly rely on encouraging immigrants to come and develop unused land.
At present the conditions are right for getting immigrants. The various counties
should do a large amount of organizational work. According to circumstances
they should determine specific tasks for the new and old households separately.
Like Yan'an county they should make specific sowing and planting plans for
each household. Such plans should include both the opening up of new land
and the planting of cultivated land. For 1943 the planned increase in production
of grain for the entire Border Region has been fixed as 80,000
<B><I>tan</I></B> of hulled grain. This should be achieved through the people
and the troops opening new lands and improving agricultural methods.
<P>
Our third agricultural policy is to increase the planting of cotton. The
entire Border Region needs 3 million <B><I>jin</I></B> of cotton. If on average
each <B><I>mu</I></B> of land can yield a net total of 20
<B><I>jin</I></B> of raw cotton, we only need 150,000 <B><I>mu</I></B> of
land for cotton. If each <B><I>mu</I></B> can only yield a net total of 15
<B><I>jin</I></B> or even less, we shall need 200,000 <B><I>mu</I></B>. We
should prepare our cotton-land according to the latter estimates. But because
households planting cotton for the first time lack experience and faith,
even if we expand the area planted to cotton, the harvest will not live up
to expectations. Therefore it is not possible to attain the full target for
cotton production in a single year and we should increase cotton land by
56,000 <B><I>mu</I></B> in 1943. Together with the previous 94,000
<B><I>mu</I></B>, the total will be 150,000 <B><I>mu</I></B> making it possible
to increase production to 2,250,000 <B><I>jin</I></B>. There is no problem
over land and seed for planting this area of cotton, but there is a great
shortage of cotton-ginning equipment. If each ginning machine can gin 60
<B><I>jin</I></B> of cotton per day on average, we need 300 machines in order
to be able to gin 3 million <B><I>jin</I></B> of cotton in half a year. In
1943 there will be 2,250,000 <B><I>jin</I></B> of cotton to be ginned. For
this we need more than 200 machines. However, at present there are only a
hundred or so broken and old machines of which only fifty can be used every
day. If we attempt to gin 2 million <B><I>jin</I></B> of cotton on fifty
machines we will need two whole years. Therefore solving the problem of ginning
the cotton is a vitally necessary part of the policy of expanding the planting
of cotton. A further point is that up to the present the peasants of the
Border Region have still not learned to press cotton-seed oil. With 2 million
<B><I>jin</I></B> cotton we will also get 4 million of cotton seed. Each
100 <B><I>jin</I></B> can produce 12 <B><I>jin</I></B> of cotton-seed oil.
If we can solve the problem of pressing the oil, then the returns to the
peasants growing cotton will increase. Their enthusiasm for growing cotton
will also rise. In relation to the above needs, in 1943 the government should
do the following work to expand the planting of cotton<B>:</B> (1) Allocate
the planting of cotton to peasant households with suitable land so as to
make a total of 150,000 <B><I>mu</I></B>. Help the households planting cotton
with seed, manure and techniques. Those who have difficulties with draught
animals and implements should be given credit. (2) Construct cotton-ginning
machines and spare parts, and supply them to the peasants planting cotton.
Help them to repair old machines. At the same time organize them to buy
cotton-ginning machines from outside areas, helping with credit. In these
ways solve the problem of ginning the cotton. (3) Do research into methods
of pressing cotton-seed oil so that the peasants planting cotton will be
able to extract 480,000 <B><I>jin</I></B> of oil from the 4 million
<B><I>jin</I></B> of seed (each <B><I>jin</I></B> is worth 15 <I>yuan</I>,
a total value of 7,200,000 <I>yuan</I>). (4) Organize joint public and private
cotton cooperatives to undertake work such as cotton-ginning, making up into
bundles, selling, pressing oil and so forth. (5) Give rewards to peasants
good at growing cotton and introduce good methods of planting cotton and
ginning so as to increase the enthusiasm of the peasants growing cotton and
to raise the amount and quality of the cotton.
<P>
Our fourth agricultural poling is not to violate the agricultural seasons.
That is, in busy agricultural seasons we should allow the peasants to cease
all meetings and mobilization work which is not related to agriculture. Under
the present circumstances in the Shaan-Kan-Ning Border Region, in busy
agricultural seasons we should stop all meetings and mobilization of the
peasant masses outside of their agricultural work, so as to economize on
labour and animal power, and let it all be used for agricultural production.
Essential meetings and mobilization should be carried out during gaps in
the work. The previous mistake of holding too many meetings and too much
mobilization must be corrected.
<P>
Our fifth agricultural policy is better adjustment in the use of labour power.
To this end there are the following methods: incentives to immigrants, mutual-aid
labour, mobilization of women, mobilization of loafers, emphasizing support
for families with kin serving as soldiers in the War of Resistance, granting
leave of absence to take part in the War of Resistance, granting leave of
absence to take part in production, obtaining help from the troops, and so
forth. All of these assist in adjusting the use of labour power.
<P>
As regards incentives to immigrants, we must rely on cooperation between
the government and the people. The methods to be employed are as follows.
(1) the Party and government of the Suide-Mizhi special military area should
be responsible for organizing immigrants with a total of 5,000 labour powers
to go to the directly administered counties to open up unused land. However,
the basic principle must be voluntary participation, and all kinds of propaganda
and organizational work should be done. (2) The government should set aside
some grain for lending to immigrants who need help. It should also provide
credit for agricultural implements and fully carry out preferential treatment
by waiving grain tax for three years. (3) The old households should be encouraged
to help the new households by lending grain, giving up some cultivated land,
lending out cave houses, and so forth. In these loans the peasant doing the
lending should be permitted to charge some interest, with the rate freely
decided by the two parties. (4) Peasant households with a good basis should
be organized to take on the poorest immigrants as tenants [huozhong]. The
amount of rent should not be excessively low, so that the old households
will be happy to take them on. (5) Immigrants from outside should be encouraged
to come by old households who have contact with outside areas. Each county
in the frontier areas should have a special person responsible for their
reception. He should tell them about regions where there is land to be opened
up so that they can go there and settle down. For example recently 600 refugees
from Henan came to Longdong sub-region; they should be welcomed in this way.
<P>
Mutual-aid labour means that within one village or among several villages
the peasant households not only plough and plant their land independently
but in busy seasons also carry out mutual aid. For example, on a voluntary
basis five, six seven or eight households can become one group. Those that
have labour power can supply labour power. Those that have animal power can
supply animal power. Those that have a lot can supply a lot, those that have
little can supply a little. In rotation and collectively they can plough
hoe, and harvest for each household in the group, and they can settle accounts
in autumn. Work can be repaid by equal amounts of work. Those who supply
more can receive supplementary wages from those who supply less, according
to the wage rate of the village. This method is called mutual-aid labour.
The mutual-aid cooperatives and ploughing teams previously set up throughout
the Kiangsi Soviet were all organized according to this method. In villages
with a large population, several small teams can join together into a mutual-aid
cooperative. The teams have a team head and a deputy head. Cooperatives have
a cooperative head and a deputy cooperative head. Adjustment in the use of
labour can also take place between cooperatives. These, then are the labour
cooperatives of the peasant masses. They are extremely effective. Not only
do they mean that peasant households which lack labour power can plant, hoe
and harvest at the correct time, but also those households which do not lack
labour power can, through collective labour, get even more profit from their
planting, hoeing and harvesting. This method is entirely beneficial and has
no drawbacks. We should promote it widely. The system of exchange-labour
teams which some areas in the Border Region have already implemented is the
same method. Each county should strive to organize mutual-aid cooperatives
and greatly expand collective labour by the peasants. Apart from this, there
are contract-labour teams. These are also welcomed by the peasants of the
Border Region. The method is not one of mutual aid but a kind of hired-labour
organization for the busy agricultural seasons. Several people or even more
form a group and collectively work for the people who hire them. When they
have finished working for one household they go to another. It is another
method of adjusting the use of labour power. All areas should help those
who come from outside to do contract labour by helping them to find work
to do and so forth.
<P>
As for mobilizing women to take part in production, although many of the
women of the Border Region have bound feet, they are still a large labour
force second only to the men. They can take part in various kinds of
supplementary agricultural work such as planting vegetables, sowing seeds,
hoeing weeds, feeding livestock, taking food to the fields, drawing water,
and gathering the harvest, etc. There are also some who can take part in
basic labour. They have generally done these things in the past. In future
we should spread propaganda and encouragement widely, stimulating their
enthusiasm for labour so as to raise agricultural production. Comrades in
the leading organs of Party and mass organizations for women have as yet
not found the orientation for their work. They feel there is nothing that
they can do. In fact their first task should be that of looking into and
helping the women of the Border Region to play a wider role in productive
labour, so that all those women who can take part in labour go to the production
front and together with the men solve the great problem of how to increase
production. There are sill a large number of women in the Border Region who
have not untied their bound feet. This is a great hindrance to labour and
production. We should use the two methods propaganda and compulsion so that
within a few years we make them untie their bound feet. Henceforth no one
is permitted to bind the feet of young girls, no matter who they are.
<P>
As for mobilizing loafers to take part in productive labors, we have already
had some remarkable successes over the past few years. After the various
counties did this work, the number of loafers greatly decreased. However,
in those regions where they still exist we should use both persuasion and
compulsion to mobilize all of them to go to the production front during 1943.
The experience of Yan'an county in this work is good, Bolshevik experience.
Mobilizing loafers to take part in production not only increases the labour
force but also reduces the number of bad people doing bad things. It is supported
by the people and strengthens social peace.
<P>
When emphasizing support for families with members working in the War of
Resistance, we have in the past put support for families with civilian personnel
in first place and support for families with kin serving as soldiers in the
War of Resistance second. This is entirely wrong. Now we should reverse this
and put support for families with kin serving as soldiers in the War of
Resistance first. The system of substitute cultivation [daigengzhi] should
first be applied conscientiously for those family dependents of soldiers
in the army resisting Japan who lack labour power (making no distinction
between our own army and friendly armies). Secondly it should be applied
to those dependants of workers in the Party and government who truly lack
labour power. In those areas where labour cooperatives [exchange-labour teams]
have been successfully organized, the solution of this problem can be entrusted
to the cooperative.
<P>
Granting leave of absence to take part in production means that in the busy
agricultural seasons Party and government officials in the Border Region
whose families have difficulties are each year permitted to return home on
two occasions, each time for several days, so that they can take part in
family based agricultural production. The primary and secondary school of
the Border Region should also stop classes in the busy agricultural seasons,
letting the students and local teachers return home to help production. This
is another method of adjusting the use of labour.
<P>
The armed forces assisting in production means that each busy agricultural
season the troops of the Border Region spend several days helping the peasants
in the areas around where they are stationed with the ploughing, hoeing and
harvesting. Moreover they do not receive any payment (they eat their own
food). On the one hand this can help adjust the use of labour power, and
on the other hand it can strengthen the relationship between the army and
the people. The political work departments of the army should plan this work.
<P>
If all the above seven ways of adjusting the use of labour power are well
implemented, they will be of great help to agricultural production in the
Border Region. Among them the most important is the mutual-aid cooperative,
which should be realized generally throughout the whole Border Region.
<P>
Our sixth agricultural policy is to increase agricultural credit. In 1942
the government issued credit for draught animals, cotton-planting, water
conservancy work and so forth. This was greatly appreciated by the peasants
and helped some of them to overcome their difficulties. One-third of the
peasants of the Border Region lack draught animals and agricultural implements.
This is an extremely: important problem. If we want agriculture to develop,
helping this huge number of peasant masses to solve their difficulties is
a very important policy. One way of doing this is to increase agricultural
credit. In 1942 under the sponsorship of the Border Region Bank, 1,580,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B> of credit for draught animals and agricultural implements
was issued to 8,025 peasant households in the seven counties, Yan'an, Ganquan,
Fuxian, Ansai, Zichang, Gulin and Zhidan. Together with capital of more than
1,030,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> amassed by the peasants themselves, this bought
2,672 draught animals, and 4,980 pieces of agricultural equipment. Over 100,000
<B><I>mu</I></B> of new land was opened up and grain production increased
by an estimated 26,000 odd <B><I>tan</I></B>. In addition, the three counties
Yanchang, Yanchuan and Gulin issued 1,530 <B><I>yuan</I></B> of credit for
planting cotton and for cotton-seedlings. The area planted to cotton grew
by over 51,000 'a and could produce an estimated increase of 870,000 Jin
of cotton. In view of the achievements through agricultural credit in 1942,
a further 17 million <I>y<B>uan</B></I> should be lent in 1943 in addition
to re-lending the 3,110,000 <B><I>yuan</I>. </B>Of this, 14 million
<B><I>yuan</I> </B>should be credit for agricultural implements and draught
animals and 3 million <I>y<B>uan</B></I> should be for planting cotton. Based
on the experience in issuing credit in 1942, methods for credit in 1943 Should
pay attention to the following points<B>:</B>
<P>
(1) Credit should be given in those regions which have a lot of unused land
to new and old immigrants and old households of poor peasants who have
labour-power but lack implements, draught animals and grain, and to peasant
households which have planted a lot of land but have no money with which
to hire labour for hoeing.
<P>
(2) After trials by the Commodities Bureau <I>[Wuzi Ju].</I> we should introduce
loans in kind, buying draught animals and suitable implants from outside
or assisting peasant households themselves to purchase them. Only in this
way can we truly increase the draught animals and agricultural implements
in the Border Region. Otherwise the peasants can only buy implements and
animals from the rich peasants and landlords of the Border Region with their
Border Region currency. This merely has the function of adjusting the ownership
of animals and tools within the Border Region and does not increase the total
stock of animals and implements.
<P>
(3) Agricultural credit for next year has already been increased. We should
also alter the policy used this year of concentrating issue of credit in
the counties around Yan'an. We should issue a suitable amount to the Sui-Mi,
Longdong, Sanbian, and Guanzhong<B> </B>sub-regions. But this should not
be done on an egalitarian basis. Instead it should be issued in a planned
way to those counties, districts and peasant households where there is a
lot of unused land, where the need for funds is greatest, and where there
can be profitable production.
<P>
(4) The organization for issuing credit must be improved. That is to<B>
</B>say, credit must be issued through district and township governments,
and cooperatives which have the trust of the masses. Therefore the cadres
of the districts and townships must be made to recognize the great significance
of agricultural credit in the development of agriculture. They must not look
upon it as a disaster-relief system. They may not adopt a policy of egalitarian
distribution nor an irresponsible attitude.
<P>
(5) The formalities for issuing credit must be simple. Use the local methods
for giving credit with which the peasants are already familiar. There is
no need for formalities such as the 'letter of request for credit', etc.
<P>
(6) Of the total agricultural credit of 20,110,000 <I>y<B>uan</B> </I>set
aside 8 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> specially as credit for cotton and wheat
seedlings, The households which borrow this can repay in kind after the cotton
and wheat harvest. Although these funds are specified as funds for cotton
and wheat seedlings, the peasants should be able to use them freely. Such
credit is of mutual benefit to public<B> </B>and private interests. The
government gets repayment in kind and the peasants can reduce exploitation
through paying high interest rates on loans.
<P>
(7) The issue of credit should not violate the agricultural seasons. The
Finance Department <I>[Caiting] </I>and the Border- Region Bank should make
rapid plans so as to issue half of the entire total<B> </B>of credit before
the end of the lunar year this year, that<B> </B>is about 10 million
<B><I>yuan</I></B>.
<P>
Our seventh agricultural policy is to improve agricultural techniques. Improving
techniques means carrying out research into things that are feasible, starting
from the existing agricultural techniques and the peasants' production skills
in the Border Region. The aim is to help the peasants improve the mayor processes
in the production of grain and cotton and to increase production. Some
improvements are very possible. We have already had quite a lot of experience.
It is wrong to lack faith and enthusiasm on this point. However, there is
no basis for boasting of the possibility of great improvement, or for considering
that we can realize modernized, large-scale agricultural techniques in the
Border Region.
<P>
How should we implement this policy? We consider that the following things
should be done:
<P>
(1) We should build effective water conservancy projects. Jingbian provides
an example. In Yangquiaopan, Changcheng district, Jingbian county there are
25,000 <B><I>mu</I></B> of land that can be irrigated. They have already
irrigated 5,000 <B><I>mu</I></B>. In 1943 they want to carry out further
construction. According to the Jingbian comrades, 1 <B><I>mu</I></B> of dry
land only yields 1 <B><I>tou</I></B> of hulled grain. However 1
<B><I>mu</I></B> of irrigated land can be planted three times per year. The
first planting is spring wheat which yields 8 <B><I>tou</I></B>, equal to
4 <B><I>tou</I></B> of hulled grain. The second planting is black beans,
yielding 4 <B><I>tou</I></B> equal to 2 <B><I>tou</I></B> of hulled grain.
The final planting is turnips,<B> </B>yielding 2,000 <B><I>jin</I></B>. Each
is worth 0.3 <I><B>yuan</B></I> and the total value is 600 <B><I>yuan</I>.
</B>On the basis of each <B><I>tou</I> </B>of hulled grain being worthy of
150 <B><I>yuan</I></B>, this is the equivalent of 4 <B><I>tou</I></B> of
hulled grain. These three things give a total equivalent of 1 <B><I>tan
</I></B>of hulled grain. This is ten times the yield of dry land Therefore
the peasants of Jingbian often proudly say, 'Plant wheat first and then black
beans. The black bean forest contains turnips too.' The major problems in
constructing irrigated land are those of the distribution of land rights,
of mobilizing manpower, of organizational leadership, and of building ditches
and dykes. If one of these four is not right then nothing can be achieved.
In 1942 the comrades of Jingbian led the peasants to construct six dykes
in Tuwan and Yangquiaopan. etc. After the dykes they built ditches, channeling
in the water to irrigate the land. First of all they solved the question
of land rights by dividing the new irrigated land between landlords and peasants
at ratios of 70 per cent to 30 per cent, 60 per cent to 40 per cent, or half
and half. This aroused the enthusiasm of the peasant masses. According to
the comrades from Jingbian: 'So long as the problem of land rights is solved,
it is easy to call on the peasants. For example, we constructed ten irrigated
areas. Over a hundred new households came in addition to the existing 200
peasant households and of these more than thirty came from other districts.'
They also say: 'Government funds are very important in the construction of
irrigated land. However we must mainly rely on the organization of manpower
and on unutilized capital. In Jingbian we built 5,000 <B><I>mu</I></B> of
irrigated land in 1942. Altogether we used 28,560 labour days, which is an
average of 5.7 per <B><I>mu</I></B>. The total funds were 858,000
<B><I>yuan</I></B>. Of this 210,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> came from public funds
and 648,000 <B><I>yuan</I></B> from unutilized capital absorbed. Of course
a large proportion of these resources was made up by the ordinary folk giving
their labour instead of cash.'
<P>
As regards organization and leadership, the Jingbian comrades Say:
<P>
'We adopted the following two methods of leadership when building irrigated
Land. First we organized water conservancy committees of three to five men
from good peasants in the locality. These were responsible for balancing
equitably the use of labour, tools, and so forth. However, it was often difficult
for them to solve problems of property rights and water-use rights, hindering
the implementation of water-conservation work. Therefore it was necessary
to have a second method whereby the government delegated cadres to assist
in leadership and to solve difficult disputes among the masses. Cadres from
the Water Conservancy Bureau<I> [<B>shuili Ju</B>]</I> and a further three
delegated by the county government took partial control of construction at
the ten sites.'
<P>
The comrades of Jingbian have also decided that in 1943 they will continue
by constructing 4,000 <B><I>mu</I></B> of irrigated land in Yangquiaopan.
However since there were originally only sixty households there and in 1942
only about forty new households came in, the total of a hundred or sixty
households still leaves a problem of labour power. They have therefore decided
to appeal for a hundred households to come in 1943. At present they have
already begun to dig out cave houses and to prepare dwellings. 'Settling
a hundred immigrant households is a heavy task. Since most of them came from
Hengshan and many will be refugees, they will need a lot of credit if we
are to succeed. If the immigrants arrive, together with the labour power
already in the area there will be no difficulty in constructing, 4,000
<B><I>mu</I></B> in 1943.' As well as this the comrades of Jingbian have
also built a kind of ' water-logged land' <B><I>[Shuimandi].</I></B> Water-logged
lands are 'large pieces of flat land surrounded on three sides by high mountains
and on the fourth side by a deep gully <B><I>[tian</I> <I>qou].</I></B> Some
are 2,000 to 3,000 <B><I>mu</I></B> and some are 200 to 300
<B><I>mu</I></B>. The soil of such land is very good but on top of it is
piled sand and gravel which obstructs the seedlings and spoils the quality
of the soil'. The method of constructing water-logged land is 'to build a
solid dyke along the side of the gully on top of which sand willows<B>
</B><I>[<B>shaliu</B>] </I>and pea-trees <I>[<B>ningtiozi</B>] </I>(in<I>
</I>winter this supplies food for the sheep) are planted. This dyke prevents
the water that runs off the mountains during the course of the year from
flowing away through the gully. It all lies on the land. The mud is very
thick. It is extremely fertile and has a high water-content. It is very good
for planting crops. Furthermore, each year the area expands and the mountain
gullies become flat land. Thus the productive area is increased'. The yield
of this water-logged land is more than double that of dry land. 'Five
<B><I>mu</I></B> of dry land yields 1 <B><I>tan</I></B> of grain but 5
<B><I>mu</I></B> of water-logged land can yield 2 or 3 <B>tan.</B> The comrades
of Jingbian only discovered how to build this water-logged land during the
mobilization for the spring ploughing in 1942. Therefore<B> </B>it has as
yet only been tried out in two places totaling 1,000 <B><I>mu</I></B>. They
are preparing to construct such lands in a good many places in 1943 and the
total area will be over 13,000 <B><I>mu</I></B>. They say 'In the entire
county from 50,000 to 60,000 <B><I>mu</I></B> of water-logged land can be
built'. I have given the example of Jingbian in detail to prove that the
case for building water conservancy works is far from hopeless. Conditions
for doing so exist in several places. In particular the conscientious and
practical spirit of the comrades of Jingbian provides an effective model
for the various counties. Although the water-conservancy conditions in other
counties cannot be the same as those in Jingbian, by relying on the leadership
of the Party and government and the efforts of the people some water conservancy
can be started in those places where conditions are really right. In 1943
the<B> </B>government should set aside 2 million <B><I>yuan</I></B> as funds
for carrying aft water conservancy works in the Yangquiaopan area of Jingbian,
the Huluhe area of Fuxian and so forth.
<P>
(2) We should popularize the use of superior-quality seeds. If we have good
seeds we can get a bigger harvest even without increasing labour and manure.
For example the Guanghua agricultural station has already successfully tried
out the 'Wolf's tail' seed. It has a high yield, is resistant to insects
and birds, and can be planted anywhere. There? sweet-potato yield is also
higher than average. We should encourage the peasants to plant them. First
each county should select one or two districts and order some peasants to
carry out tests. If they find the soil and climate suitable, then such seeds
can be popularized so as to increase production.
<P>
(3) We should encourage the opening up of new land and the turning over of
the earth during autumn, as this can reduce insect pests and promote the
aeration of the soil. It can also conserve the water content and increase
the harvest of the following year.
<P>
(4) After popularizing the organization of mutual-aid cooperatives we should
encourage the peasants to increase the number of times they hoe weeds. The
purpose of hoeing weeds is not only to get rid of weeds and to help the seedling,
but also to conserve water and resist drought. If we increase the number
of times we undertake hoeing, we can increase the amount of harvest even
if we do not use much manure.
<P>
(5) In the summer and winter of 1943 the five sub-regions should separately
hold exhibitions organized by the Reconstruction Department
[<B><I>Jianting</I></B>] and five special offices <I>[<B>zhuanshu</B>]. </I>In
the light of the experience of the two previous agricultural exhibitions
in the Border Region, we should improve the layout, introduce and promote
the achievements of model-peasants, and popularize an agricultural production
movement in the labour style and skills of Wu Manyou. In 1943 the agricultural
exhibition of the sub-regions should include the achievements of the troops,
the official organizations and schools in agricultural production. This will
encourage their agricultural production and will also promote unity between
the troops and the people.
<P>
(6) In 1943 the <B><I>Liberian Daily</I></B> and <B><I>Border Region Masses
Dally</I></B> should widely promote the Wu Manyou production movement so
that many more Wu Manyous will be created within the five sub-regions.
<P>
(7) The primary and secondary schools of the Border Region<B> </B>should
run general agricultural knowledge classes and edit textbooks for winter-study
containing practical information on Border Region agriculture with the aim
of improving agriculture and<B> </B>increasing production.
<P>
(8) the Reconstruction Department should call a meeting of experts to<B>
</B>get down to research on the 'willow-root' water which flows<B> </B>from
the hilltops, so as to deal with it in a scientific manner<B> </B>and to
prevent people from contracting 'limping sickness' after drinking it. If
this problem can be salved then much fertile<B> </B>land in the neighborhood
of the hills can be put under the<B> </B>plough and become good arable land.
<P>
Our eighth agricultural policy is to implement progressive agricultural taxation.
<P>
In the past agricultural taxation was in the form of national salvation grain
tax. Although it was levied on progressive principles, the amount levied
each year was not standard. The amount levied per family varied from year
to year. In 1941 there were cases of taxes being apportioned out <I>[tanpai].
</I>Although an assessment method <I>[pinquizhi] </I>was instituted in 1942
as being more equitable, there were still inequalities . The most important
failing was that the amount of tax was not fixed. This dampened the enthusiasm
of the peasants for production. We propose that in 1943 the government should
examine and register the land held by the people, and thereby construct a
simple progressive agricultural tax. The amount of tax should be decided
according to the amount of land, its quality, and so forth. In this way the
peasant will be able to calculate the amount of tax themselves according
to the amount and quality of the land they farm. Once the peasants can do
this, they can work out the ratio between income and expenditure for the
family for the entire year. They can then set-to and produce with greater
enthusiasm for production. This will guarantee an increase in the production
of grain. Moreover, inequalities will not arise when the government levies
the tax. After carrying out the preparatory work in 1943, we can implement
progressive taxation in 1944. Counties where preparation is completed early,
can carry it out on a trial basis in 1943.
<P>
Reduction of rent and of interest rates, an increase in opening up new lands,
popularizing the planting of cotton, not violating agricultural seasons,
better adjustment in the use of labour power, an increase in agricultural
credit, improvements of agricultural techniques, and preparation for implementing
a progressive tax &#151; these eight items are the effective agricultural
policies which we can and meat carry out in 1943. With the exception of the
progressive tax for which we can make preparations and which can be tried
out in a few counties, the other seven items should be implemented immediately.
Many of them should commence during the winter of 1942. Otherwise the time
will be lost and they will become empty words.
<P>
The above is a summary of our work as regards agriculture in the private
sector and our strategy for 1943. What follows is a discussion of closely
related agricultural subsidiary undertakings such as animal husbandry and
handicrafts.
