<P>
Dear Comrades-in-Arms-and Immortal Heroes,
<P>
In the last few decades you rendered your glorious service to the people.
Now in dying for them your deaths are also glorious.
<P>
Your deaths are a clarion call to deepen the Chinese people's understanding
of the CCP and to strengthen their determination to defend peace, democracy,
and unity.
<P>
Your deaths are a clarion call to the whole party and the whole nation to
unite in the struggle for a peaceful, democratic, and united China.
<P>
The whole party and the whole nation will carry on your unfinished tasks
and continue to struggle till victory is won. They will never relax or shrink
back from their effort.
<P>
