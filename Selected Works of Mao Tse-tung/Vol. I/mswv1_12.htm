<H1>PROBLEMS OF STRATEGY IN CHINA'S REVOLUTIONARY WAR</H1>

<p class="information">
[Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote this work to sum up the experience of the Second
Revolutionary Civil War and used it for his lectures at the Red Army College
in northern Shensi. Only five chapters were completed. The chapters on the
strategic offensive, political work and other problems were left undone because
he was too busy in consequence of the Sian Incident. This work, a result
of a major inner-Party controversy on military questions during the Second
Revolutionary Civil War, gives expression to one line in military affairs
as against another. The enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee held at Tsunyi in January 1935 settled the controversy about the
military line, reaffirmed Comrade Mao Tse-tung's views and repudiated the
erroneous line. In October 1935 the Central Committee moved to northern Shensi,
and in December Comrade Mao Tse-tung made a report "On Tactics Against Japanese
Imperialism" in which problems concerning the political line of the Party
in the Second Revolutionary Civil War were systematically solved. He wrote
this work a year later, in 1936, to explain the problems of strategy in China's
revolutionary war in a systematic way.]

<H3><em>CHAPTER I.</em></H3>
<H3>HOW TO STUDY WAR</H3>
<H4>1. THE LAWS OF WAR ARE DEVELOPMENTAL</H4>
<P>
<P>
<em>The laws of war</em> are a problem which anyone directing a war must study
and solve.
<P>
<em>The laws of revolutionary war </em>are a problem which anyone directing
a revolutionary war must study and solve.
<P>
<em>The laws of China's revolutionary war </em>are a problem which anyone directing
China's revolutionary war must study and solve.
<P>
We are now engaged in a war; our war is a revolutionary war; and our
revolutionary war is being waged in this semi-colonial and semi-feudal country
of China. Therefore, we must study not only the laws of war in general, but
the specific laws of revolutionary war, and the even more specific laws of
revolutionary war in China.
<P>
It is well known that when you do anything, unless you understand its actual
circumstances, its nature and its relations to other things, you will not
know the laws governing it, or know how to do it, or be able to do it well.
<P>
<em>War is </em>the highest form of struggle for resolving contradictions,
when they have developed to a certain stage, between classes, nations, states,
or political groups, and it has existed ever since the emergence of private
property and of classes. Unless you understand the actual circumstances of
war, its nature and its relations to other things, you will not know the
laws of war, or know how to direct war, or be able to win victory.
<P>
<em>Revolutionary war, </em>whether a revolutionary class war or a revolutionary
national war, has its own specific circumstances and nature, in addition
to the circumstances and nature of war in general. Therefore, besides the
general laws of war, it has specific laws of its own. Unless you understand
its specific circumstances and nature, unless you understand its specific
laws, you will not be able to direct a revolutionary war and wage it
successfully.
<P>
<em>China's revolutionary war, </em>whether civil war or national war, is waged
in the specific environment of China and so has its own specific circumstances
and nature distinguishing it both from war in general and from revolutionary
war in general. Therefore, besides the laws of war in general and of
revolutionary war in general, it has specific laws of its own. Unless you
understand them, you will not be able to win in China's revolutionary war.
<P>
Therefore, we must study the laws of war in general, we must also study the
laws of revolutionary war, and, finally, we must study the laws of China's
revolutionary war.
<P>
Some people hold a wrong view, which we refuted long ago. They say that it
is enough merely to study the laws of war in general, or, to put it more
concretely, that it is enough merely to follow the military manuals published
by the reactionary Chinese government or the reactionary military academies
in China. They do not see that these manuals give merely the laws of war
in general and moreover are wholly copied from abroad, and that if we copy
and apply them exactly without the slightest change in form or content, we
shall be "cutting the feet to fit the shoes" and be defeated. Their argument
is: why should knowledge which has been acquired at the cost of blood be
of no use? They fail to see that although we must cherish the earlier experience
thus acquired, we must also cherish experience acquired at the cost of our
own blood.
<P>
Others hold a second wrong view, which we also refuted long ago. They say
that it is enough merely to study the experience of revolutionary war in
Russia, or, to put it more concretely, that it is enough merely to follow
the laws by which the civil war in the Soviet Union was directed and the
military manuals published by Soviet military organizations. They do not
see that these laws and manuals embody the specific characteristics of the
civil war and the Red Army in the Soviet Union, and that if we copy and apply
them without allowing any change, we shall also be "cutting the feet to fit
the shoes" and be defeated. Their argument is: since our war, like the war
in the Soviet Union, is a revolutionary war, and since the Soviet Union won
victory, how then can there be any alternative but to follow the Soviet example?
They fail to see that while we should set special store by the war experience
of the Soviet Union, because it is the most recent experience of revolutionary
war and was acquired under the guidance of Lenin and Stalin, we should likewise
cherish the experience of China's revolutionary war, because there are many
factors that are specific to the Chinese revolution and the Chinese Red Army.
<P>
Still others hold a third wrong view, which we likewise refuted long ago.
They say that the most valuable experience is that of the Northern Expedition
of 1926-27 and that we must learn from it, or, to put it more concretely,
that we must imitate the Northern Expedition in driving straight ahead to
seize the big cities. They fail to see that while the experience of the Northern
Expedition should be studied, it should not be copied and applied mechanically,
because the circumstances of our present war are different. We should take
from the Northern Expedition only what still applies today, and work out
something of our own in the light of present conditions.
<P>
Thus the different laws for directing different wars are determined by the
different circumstances of those wars--differences in their time, place and
nature. As regards the time factor, both war and its laws develop; each
historical stage has its special characteristics, and hence the laws of war
in each historical stage have their special characteristics and cannot be
mechanically applied in another stage. As for the nature of war, since
revolutionary war and counterrevolutionary war both have their special
characteristics, the laws governing them also have their own characteristics,
and those applying to one cannot be mechanically transferred to the other.
As for the factor of place, since each country or nation, especially a large
country or nation, has its own characteristics, the laws of war for each
country or nation also have their own characteristics, and here, too, those
applying to one cannot be mechanically transferred to the other. In studying
the laws for directing wars that occur at different historical stages, that
differ in nature and that are waged in different places and by different
nations, we must fix our attention on the characteristics and development
of each, and must oppose a mechanical approach to the problem of war.
<P>
Nor is this all. It signifies progress and development in a commander who
is initially capable of commanding only a small formation, if he becomes
capable of commanding a big one. There is also a difference between operating
in one locality and in many. It likewise signifies progress and development
in a commander who is initially capable of operating only in a locality he
knows well, if he becomes capable of operating in many other localities.
Owing to technical, tactical and strategic developments on the enemy side
and on our own, the circumstances also differ from stage to stage within
a given war. It signifies still more progress and development in a commander
who is capable of exercising command in a war at its lower stages, if he
becomes capable of exercising command in its higher stages. A commander who
remains capable of commanding only a formation of a certain size, only in
a certain locality and at a certain stage in the development of a war shows
that he has made no progress and has not developed. There are some people
who, contented with a single skill or a peep-hole view, never make any progress,
they may play some role in the revolution at a given place and time, but
not a significant one. We need directors of war who can play a significant
role. All the laws for directing war develop as history develops and as war
develops; nothing is changeless.

<H4>2. THE AIM OF WAR IS TO ELIMINATE WAR</H4>

<P>
War, this monster of mutual slaughter among men, will be finally eliminated
by the progress of human society, and in the not too distant future too.
But there is only one way to eliminate it and that is to oppose war with
war, to oppose counter-revolutionary war with revolutionary war, to oppose
national counter-revolutionary war with national revolutionary war, and to
oppose counter-revolutionary class war with revolutionary class war. History
knows only two kinds of war, just and unjust. We support just wars and oppose
unjust wars. All counter-revolutionary wars are unjust, all revolutionary
wars are just. Mankind's era of wars will be brought to an end by our own
efforts, and beyond doubt the war we wage is part of the final battle. But
also beyond doubt the war we face will be part of the biggest and most ruthless
of all wars. The biggest and most ruthless of unjust counter-revolutionary
wars is hanging over us, and the vast majority of mankind will be ravaged
unless we raise the banner of a just war. The banner of mankind's just war
is the banner of mankind's salvation. The banner of China's just war is the
banner of China's salvation. A war waged by the great majority of mankind
and of the Chinese people is beyond doubt a just war, a most lofty and glorious
undertaking for the salvation of mankind and China, and a bridge to a new
era in world history. When human society advances to the point where classes
and states are eliminated, there will be no more wars, counter-revolutionary
or revolutionary, unjust or just; that will be the era of perpetual peace
for mankind. Our study of the laws of revolutionary war springs from the
desire to eliminate all wars; herein lies the distinction between us Communists
and all the exploiting classes.
<H4>3. STRATEGY IS THE STUDY OF THE LAWS OF A WAR SITUATION AS A WHOLE</H4>
<P>
Wherever there is war, there is a war situation as a whole. The war situation
as a whole may cover the entire world, may cover an entire country, or may
cover an independent guerrilla zone or an independent major operational front.
Any war situation which acquires a comprehensive consideration of its various
aspects and stages forms a war situation as a whole.
<P>
The task of the science of strategy is to study those laws for directing
a war that govern a war situation as a whole. The task of the science of
campaigns and the science of tactics [<A href="#BM1">1</A>] is to study those
laws for directing a war that govern a partial situation.
<P>
Why is it necessary for the commander of a campaign or a tactical operation
to understand the laws of strategy to some degree? Because an understanding
of the whole facilitates the handling of the part, and because the part is
subordinate to the whole. The view that strategic victory is determined by
tactical successes alone is wrong because it overlooks the fact that victory
or defeat in a war is first and foremost a question of whether the situation
as a whole and its various stages are properly taken into account. If there
are serious defects or mistakes in taking the situation as a whole and its
various stages into account, the war is sure to be lost. "One careless move
loses the whole game" refers to a move affecting the situation as a whole,
a move decisive for the whole situation, and not to a move of a partial nature,
a move which is not decisive for the whole situation. As in chess, so in
war.
<P>
But the situation as a whole cannot be detached from its parts and become
independent of them, for it is made up of all its parts. Sometimes certain
parts may suffer destruction or defeat without seriously affecting the situation
as a whole, because they are not decisive for it. Some defeats or failures
in tactical operations or campaigns do not lead to deterioration in the war
situation as a whole, because they are not of decisive significance. But
the loss of most of the campaigns making up the war situation as a whole,
or of one or two decisive campaigns, immediately changes the whole situation.
Here, "most of the campaigns" or "one or two campaigns" are decisive. In
the history of war, there are instances where defeat in a single battle nullified
all the advantages of a series of victories, and there are also instances
where victory in a single battle after many defeats opened up a new situation.
In those instances the "series of victories" and the "many defeats" were
partial in nature and not decisive for the situation as a whole, while "defeat
in a single battle" or "victory in a single battle" played the decisive role.
All this explains the importance of taking into account the situation as
a whole. What is most important for the person in over-all command is to
concentrate on attending to the war situation as a whole. The main point
is that, according to the circumstances, he should concern himself with the
problems of the grouping of his military units and formations, the relations
between campaigns, the relations between various operational stages, and
the relations between our activities as a whole and the enemy's activities
as a whole--all these problems demand his greatest care and effort, and if
he ignores them and immerses himself in secondary problems, he can hardly
avoid setbacks.
<P>
The relationship between the whole and the part holds not only for the
relationship between strategy and campaign but also for that between<B>
</B>campaign and tactics. Examples are to be found in the relation between
the operations of a division and those of its regiments and battalions, and
in the relation between the operations of a company and those of its platoons
and squads. The commanding officer at any level should centre his attention
on the most important and decisive problem or action in the whole situation
he is handling, and not on other problems or actions.
<P>
What is important or decisive should be determined not by general or abstract
considerations, but according to the concrete circumstances. In a military
operation the direction and point of assault should be selected according
to the actual situation of the enemy, the terrain, and the strength of our
own forces at the moment. One must see to it that the soldiers do not overeat
when supplies are abundant, and take care that they do not go hungry when
supplies are short. In the White areas the mere leakage of a piece of information
may cause defeat in a subsequent engagement, but in the Red areas such leakage
is often not a very serious matter. It is necessary for the high commanders
to participate personally in certain battles but not in others. For a military
school, the most important question is the selection of a director and
instructors and the adoption of a training programme. For a mass meeting,
the main thing is mobilizing the masses to attend and putting forward suitable
slogans. And so on and so forth. In a word, the principle is to centre our
attention on the important links that have a bearing on the situation as
a whole.
<P>
The only way to study the laws governing a war situation as a whole is to
do some hard thinking. For what pertains to the situation as a whole is not
visible to the eye, and we can understand it only by hard thinking; there
is no other way. But because the situation as a whole is made up of parts,
people with experience of the parts, experience of campaigns and tactics,
can understand matters of a higher order provided they are willing to think
hard. The problems of strategy include the following:
<P>
Giving proper consideration to the relation between the enemy and ourselves.
<P>
Giving proper consideration to the relation between various campaigns or
between various operational stages.
<P>
Giving proper consideration to those parts which have a bearing on (are decisive
for) the situation as a whole.
<P>
Giving proper consideration to the special features contained in the general
situation.
<P>
Giving proper consideration to the relation between the front and the rear.
<P>
Giving proper consideration to the distinction as well as the connection
between losses and replacements, between fighting and resting, between
concentration and dispersion, between attack and defence, between advance
and retreat, between concealment and exposure, between the main attack and
supplementary attacks, between assault and containing action, between centralized
command and decentralized command, between protracted war and war of quick
decision, between positional war and mobile war, between our own forces and
friendly forces, between one military arm and another, between higher and
lower levels, between cadres and the rank and file, between old and new soldiers,
between senior and junior cadres, between old and new cadres, between Red
areas and White areas, between old Red areas and new ones, between the central
district and the borders of a given base area, between the warm season and
the cold season, between victory and defeat, between large and small troop
formations, between the regular army and the guerrilla forces, between destroying
the enemy and winning over the masses, between expanding the Red Army and
consolidating it, between military work and political work, between past
and present tasks, between present and future tasks, between tasks arising
from one set of circumstances and tasks arising from another, between fixed
fronts and fluid fronts, between civil war and national war, between one
historical stage and another, etc., etc.
<P>
<P>
None of these problems of strategy is visible to the eye, and yet, if we
think hard, we can comprehend, grasp and master them all, that is, we can
raise the important problems concerning a war or concerning military operations
to the higher plane of principle and solve them. Our task in studying the
problems of strategy is to attain this goal.

<H4> 4. THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE GOOD AT LEARNING</H4>

<P>
Why have we organized the Red Army? For the purpose of defeating the enemy.
Why do we study the laws of war? For the purpose of applying them in war.
<P>
To learn is no easy matter and to apply what one has learned is even harder.
Many people appear impressive when discoursing on military science in classrooms
or in books, but when it comes to actual fighting, some win battles and others
lose them. Both the history of war and our own experience in war have proved
this point.
<P>
Where then does the crux lie?
<P>
In real life, we cannot ask for "ever-victorious generals", who are few and
far between in history. What we can ask for is generals who are brave and
sagacious and who normally win their battles in the course of a war, generals
who combine wisdom with courage. To become both wise and courageous one must
acquire a method, a method to be employed in learning as well as in applying
what has been learned.
<P>
What method? The method is to familiarize ourselves with all aspects of the
enemy situation and our own, to discover the laws governing the actions of
both sides and to make use of these laws in our own operations.
<P>
The military manuals issued in many countries point both to the necessity
of a "flexible application of principles according to circumstances" and
to the measures to be taken in case of defeat. They point to the former in
order to warn a commander against subjectively committing mistakes through
too rigid an application of principles, and to the latter in order to enable
him to cope with the situation after he has committed subjective mistakes
or after unexpected and irresistible changes have occurred in the objective
circumstances.
<P>
Why are subjective mistakes made? Because the way the forces in a war or
a battle are disposed or directed does not fit the conditions of the given
time and place, because subjective direction does not correspond to, or is
at variance with, the objective conditions, in other words, because the
contradiction between the subjective and the objective has not been resolved.
People can hardly avoid such situations whatever they are doing, but some
people prove themselves more competent than others. As in any job we demand
a comparatively high degree of competence, so in war we demand more victories
or, conversely, fewer defeats. Here the crux is to bring the subjective and
the objective into proper correspondence with each other.
<P>
Take an example in tactics. If the point chosen for attack is on one of the
enemy's flanks and it is located precisely<B> </B>where<B> </B>his<B> </B>weak
spot happens to be, and in consequence the assault succeeds, then the subjective
corresponds with the objective, that is, the commander's reconnaissance,
judgement and decision have corresponded with the enemy's actual situation
and dispositions. If the point chosen for attack is on another flank or in
the centre and the<B> </B>attack hits a snag and makes no headway, then such
correspondence<B> </B>is lacking. If the attack is properly timed, if the
reserves are used neither too late nor too early, and if all the other
dispositions and operations in the battle are such as to favour us and not
the enemy, then the subjective direction throughout the battle completely
corresponds with the objective situation. Such complete correspondence is
extremely rare in a war or a battle, in which the belligerents are groups
of live human beings bearing arms and keeping their secrets from each other;
this is quite unlike handling inanimate objects or routine matters. But if
the direction given by the commander corresponds in the main with the actual
situation, that is, if the decisive elements in the direction correspond
with the actual situation, then there is a basis for victory.
<P>
A commander's correct dispositions stem from his correct decisions, his correct
decisions stem from his correct judgements, and his correct judgements stem
from a thorough and necessary reconnaissance and from pondering on and piecing
together the data of various kinds gathered through reconnaissance. He applies
all possible and necessary methods of reconnaissance, and ponders on the
information gathered about the enemy's situation, discarding the dross and
selecting the essential, eliminating the false and retaining the true, proceeding
from the one to the other and from the outside to the inside; then, he takes
the conditions on his own side into account, and makes a study of both sides
and their interrelations, thereby forming his judgements, making up his mind
and working out his plans. Such is the complete process of knowing a situation
which a military man goes through before he formulates a strategic plan,
a campaign plan or a battle plan. But instead of doing this, a careless military
man bases his military plans on his own wishful thinking, and hence his plans
are fanciful and do not correspond with reality. A rash military man relying
solely upon enthusiasm is bound to be tricked by the enemy, or lured on by
some superficial or partial aspect of the enemy's situation, or swayed by
irresponsible suggestions from subordinates that are not based on real knowledge
or deep insight, and so he runs his head against a brick wall, because he
does not know or does not want to know that every military plan must be based
on the necessary reconnaissance and on careful consideration of the enemy's
situation, his own situation, and their interrelations.
<P>
The process of knowing a situation goes on not only before the formulation
of a military plan but also after. In carrying out the plan from the moment
it is put into effect to the end of the operation, there is another process
of knowing the situation, namely, the process of practice. In the course
of this process, it is necessary to examine anew whether the plan worked
out in the preceding process corresponds with reality. If it does not correspond
with reality, or if it does not fully do so, then in the light of our new
knowledge, it becomes necessary to form new judgements, make new decisions
and change the original plan so as to meet the new situation. The plan is
partially changed in almost every operation, and sometimes it is even changed
completely. A rash man who does not understand the need for such alterations
or is unwilling to make them, but who acts blindly, will inevitably run his
head against a brick wall.
<P>
The above applies to a strategic action, a campaign or a battle. Provided
he is modest and willing to learn, an experienced military man will be able
to familiarize himself with the character of his own forces (commanders,
men, arms, supplies, etc., and their sum total), with the character of the
enemy forces (likewise, commanders, men, arms, supplies, etc., and their
sum total) and with all other conditions related to the war, such as politics,
economics, geography and weather; such a military man will have a better
grasp in directing a war or an operation and will be more likely to win
victories. He will achieve this because, over a long period of time, he has
come to know the situation on the enemy side and his own, discovered the
laws of action, and resolved the contradictions between the subjective and
the objective. This process of knowing is extremely important; without such
a long period of experience, it would be difficult to understand and grasp
the laws of an entire war. Neither a beginner nor a person who fights only
on paper can become a really able high-ranking commander; only one who has
learned through actual fighting in war can do so.
<P>
All military laws and military theories which are in the nature of principles
are the experience of past wars summed up by people in former days or in
our own times. We should seriously study these lessons, paid for in blood,
which are a heritage of past wars. That is one point. But there is another.
We should put these conclusions to the test of our own experience, assimilating
what is useful, rejecting what is useless, and adding what is specifically
our own. The latter is very important, for otherwise we cannot direct a war.
<P>
Reading is learning, but applying is also learning and the more important
kind of learning at that. Our chief method is to learn warfare through warfare.
A person who has had no opportunity to go to school can also learn warfare--he
can learn through fighting in war. A revolutionary war is a mass undertaking,
it is often n a matter of first learning and then doing, but of doing and
the learning, for doing is itself learning. There is a gap between the ordinary
civilian and the soldier, but it is no Great Wall, and <em>it </em>can be quickly
closed, and the way to close it is to take part in revolution in war. By
saying that it is not easy to learn and to apply, we mean that It Is hard
to learn thoroughly and to apply skillfully. By saying that civilians can
very quickly become soldiers, we mean that it is not difficult to cross the
threshold. To put the two statements together we may cite the Chinese adage,
"Nothing in the world is difficult for one who sets his mind to it." To cross
the threshold is not difficult and mastery, too, is possible provided one
sets one's mind to the task and is good at learning.
<P>
The laws of war, like the laws governing all other things, are reflections
in our minds of objective realities; everything outside of the mind is objective
reality. Consequently what has to be learned and known includes the state
of affairs on the enemy side and that on our side, both of which should be
regarded as the object of study, while the mind (the capacity to think) alone
is the subject performing the study. Some people are good at knowing themselves
and poor at knowing their enemy, and some are the other way round, neither
can solve the problem of learning and applying the laws of war. There is
a saying in the book of Sun Wu Tzu, the great military scientist of ancient
China, "Know the enemy and know yourself, and you can fight a hundred battles
with no danger of defeat", [<A href="#BM2">2</A>] which refers both to the
stage of learning and to the stage of application, both to knowing the laws
of the development of objective reality and to deciding on our own action
in accordance with these laws in order to overcome the enemy facing us. We
should not take this saying lightly.
<P>
War is the highest form of struggle between nations, states, classes, or
political groups, and all the laws of war are applied by warring nations,
states, classes, or political groups for the purpose of achieving victory
for themselves. Unquestionably, victory or defeat in war is determined mainly
by the military, political, economic and natural conditions on both sides.
But not by these alone. It is also determined by each side's subjective ability
in directing the war. In his endeavour to win a war, a military man cannot
overstep the limitations imposed by the material conditions; within these
limitations, however, he can and must strive for victory. The stage of action
for a military man is built upon objective material conditions, but on that
stage he i can direct the performance of many a drama, full of sound and
colour, power and grandeur. Therefore, given the objective material foundations,
i.e., the military, political, economic and natural conditions, our Red Army
commanders must display their prowess and marshal all their forces to crush
the national and class enemies and to transform this evil world. Here is
where our subjective ability in directing war can and must be exercised.
We do not permit any of our Red Army commanders to become a blundering hothead;
we decidedly want every Red Army commander to become a hero who is both brave
and sagacious, who possesses both all-conquering courage and the ability
to remain master of the situation throughout the changes and vicissitudes
of the entire war. Swimming in the ocean of war, he not only must not flounder
but must make sure of reaching the opposite shore with measured strokes.
The laws for directing war constitute the art of swimming in the ocean of
war.
<P>
So much for our methods.
<H3><em>CHAPTER II.</em></H3>
<H3>THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY AND CHINA'S REVOLUTIONARY WAR</H3>
<P>
China's revolutionary war, which began in 1924, has passed through two stages,
the first from 1924 to 1927, and the second from 1927 to 1936; the stage
of national revolutionary war against Japan will now commence. In all three
of its stages this revolutionary war has been, is and will be fought under
the leadership of the Chinese proletariat and its party, the Chinese Communist
Party. The chief enemies in China's revolutionary war are imperialism and
the feudal forces. Although the Chinese bourgeoisie may take part in the
revolutionary war at certain historical junctures, yet its selfishness and
lack of political and economic independence render it both unwilling and
unable to lead China's revolutionary war on to the road of complete victory.
The masses of China's peasantry and urban petty bourgeoisie wish to take
an active part in the revolutionary war and to carry it to complete victory.
They are the main forces in the revolutionary war, but, being small-scale
producers, they are limited in their political outlook (and some of the
unemployed masses have anarchist views), so that they are unable to give
correct leadership in the war. Therefore, in an era when the proletariat
has already appeared on the political stage, the responsibility for leading
China's revolutionary war inevitably falls on the shoulders of the Chinese
Communist Party. In this era, any revolutionary war will definitely end in
defeat if it lacks, or runs counter to, the leadership of the proletariat
and the Communist Party. Of all the social strata and political groupings
in semi-colonial China, the proletariat and the Communist Party are the ones
most free from narrow-mindedness and selfishness, are politically the most
far-sighted, the best organized and the readiest to learn with an open mind
from the experience of the vanguard class, the proletariat, and its political
party throughout the world and to make use of this experience in their own
cause Hence only the proletariat and the Communist Party can lead the peasantry,
the urban petty bourgeoisie and bourgeoisie, can overcome the narrow-mindedness
of the peasants and the petty bourgeoisie, the destructiveness of the unemployed
masses, and also (provided the Communist Party does not err in its policy)
the vacillation and lack of thoroughness of the bourgeoisie can lead the
revolution and the war on to the road of victory.
<P>
The revolutionary war of 1924-27 was waged, basically speaking, in conditions
in which the international proletariat and the Chinese proletariat and its
party exerted political influence on the Chinese national bourgeoisie and
its parties and entered into political cooperation with them. However, this
revolutionary war failed at the critical juncture, first of all because the
big bourgeoisie turned traitor, and at the same time because the opportunists
within the revolutionary ranks voluntarily surrendered the leadership of
the revolution.
<P>
The Agrarian Revolutionary War, lasting from 1927 to the present, has been
waged under new conditions. The enemy in this war is not imperialism alone
but also the alliance of the big bourgeoisie and the big landlords. And the
national bourgeoisie has become a tail to the big bourgeoisie. This revolutionary
war is led by the Communist Party alone, which has established absolute
leadership over it. This absolute leadership is the most important condition
enabling the revolutionary war to be carried through firmly to the end. Without
it, it is inconceivable that the revolutionary war could have been carried
on with such perseverance.
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party has led China's revolutionary war courageously
and resolutely, and for fifteen long years [<A href="#BM3">3</A>] has
demonstrated to the whole nation that it is the people's friend, fighting
at all times in the forefront of the revolutionary war in defence of the
people's interests and for their freedom and liberation.
<P>
By its arduous struggles and by the martyrdom of hundreds of thousands of
its heroic members and tens of thousands of its heroic cadres, the Communist
Party of China has played a great educative role among hundreds of millions
of people throughout the country. The Party's great historic achievements
in its revolutionary struggles have provided the prerequisite for the survival
and salvation of China at this critical juncture when she is being invaded
by a national enemy; and this prerequisite is the existence of a political
leadership enjoying the confidence of the vast majority of the people and
chosen by them after long years of testing. Today, the people accept what
the Communist Party says more readily than what any other political party
says. Were it not for the arduous struggles of the Chinese Communist Party
in the last fifteen years, it would be impossible to save China in the face
of the new menace of subjugation.
<P>
Besides the errors of the Right opportunism of Chen Tu-hsiu
[<A href="#BM4">4</A>] and the "Left" opportunism of Li Li-san,
[<A href="#BM5">5</A>] the Chinese Communist Party has committed two other
errors in the course of the revolutionary war. The first error was the "Left"
opportunism of 1931-34 [<A href="#BM6">6</A>] which resulted in serious losses
in the Agrarian Revolutionary War so that, instead of our defeating the enemy's
fifth campaign of "encirclement and suppression", we lost our base areas
and the Red Army was weakened. This error was corrected at the enlarged meeting
of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee at Tsunyi in January 1935.
The second was the Right opportunism of Chang Kuo-tao in 1935-36
[<A href="#BM7">7</A>] which grew to such an extent that it undermined the
discipline of the Party and of the Red Army and caused serious losses to
part of the Red Army's main forces. But this error was also finally rectified,
thanks to the correct leadership of the Central Committee and the political
consciousness of Party members, commanders and fighters in the Red Army.
Of course all these errors were harmful to our Party, to our revolution and
the war, but in the end we overcame them, and in doing so our Party and our
Red Army have steeled themselves and become still stronger.
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party has led and continues to lead the stirring,
magnificent and victorious revolutionary war. This war is not only the banner
of China's liberation, but has international revolutionary significance as
well. The eyes of the revolutionary people the world over are upon us. In
the new stage, the stage of the anti-Japanese national revolutionary war,
we shall lead the Chinese revolution to It's completion and exert a profound
influence on the revolution in the East and in the whole world. Our revolutionary
war has proved that we need a correct Marxist military line as well as a
correct Marxist political line. Fifteen years of revolution and war have
hammered out such political and military lines. We believe that from now
on, in the new stage of the war, these lines will be further developed, filled
out and enriched in new circumstances, so that we can attain our aim of defeating
the national enemy. History tells us that correct political and military
lines do not emerge and develop spontaneously and tranquilly, but only in
the course of struggle. These lines must combat left opportunism on the one
hand and Right opportunism on the other. Without combating and thoroughly
overcoming these harmful tendencies which damage the revolution and the
revolutionary war, it would be impossible to establish a correct line and
win victory in this war. It is for this reason that I often refer to erroneous
views in this pamphlet.
<H3><em>CHAPTER III.</em></H3>
<H3>CHARACTERISTICS OF CHINA'S REVOLUTIONARY WAR</H3>
<H4>1. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT</H4>
<P>
People who do not admit, do not know, or do not want to know t at China's
revolutionary war has its own characteristics have equated the war waged
by the Red Army against the Kuomintang forces with war in general or with
the civil war in the Soviet Union. The experience of the civil war in the
Soviet Union directed by Lenin and Stalin has a world-wide significance.
All Communist Parties, including the Chinese Communist Party, regard this
experience and its theoretical summing-up by Lenin and Stalin as their guide.
But this does not mean that we should apply it mechanically to our own
conditions. In many of its aspects China's revolutionary war has characteristics
distinguishing it from the civil war in the Soviet Union. Of course it is
wrong to take no account of these characteristics or deny their existence.
This point has been fully borne out in our ten years of war.
<P>
Our enemy has made similar mistakes. He did not recognize that fighting against
the Red Army required a different strategy and different tactics from those
used in fighting other forces. Relying on his superiority in various respects,
he took us lightly and stuck to his old methods of warfare. This was the
case both before and during his fourth "encirclement and suppression" campaign
in 1933, with the result that he suffered a series of defeats. In the Kuomintang
army a new approach to the problem was suggested first by the reactionary
Kuomintang general Liu Wei-yuan and then by Tai Yueh. Their idea was eventually
accepted by Chiang Kai-shek. That was how Chiang Kai-shek's Officers' Training
Corps at Lushan [<A href="#BM8">8</A>] came into being and how the new
reactionary military principles [<A href="#BM9">9</A>] applied in the fifth
campaign of "encirclement and suppression" were evolved.
<P>
But when the enemy changed his military principles to suit operations against
the Red Army, there appeared in our ranks a group of people who reverted
to the "old ways". They urged a return to ways suited to the general run
of things, refused to go into the specific circumstances of each case, rejected
the experience gained in the Red Army's history of sanguinary battles, belittled
the strength of imperialism and the Kuomintang as well as that of the Kuomintang
army, and turned a blind eye to the new reactionary principles adopted by
the enemy. As a result, all the revolutionary bases except the Shensi-Kansu
border area were lost, the Red Army was reduced from 300,000 to a few tens
of thousands, the membership of the Chinese Communist Party fell from 300,000
to a few tens of thousands, and the Party organizations in the Kuomintang
areas were almost all destroyed. In short, we paid a severe penalty, which
was historic in its significance. This group of people called themselves
Marxist-Leninists, but actually they had not learned an iota of Marxism-Leninism.
Lenin said that the most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marxism,
is the concrete analysis of concrete conditions. [<A href="#BM10">10</A>]
That was precisely the point these comrades of ours forgot.
<P>
Hence one can see that, without an understanding of the characteristics of
China's revolutionary war, it is impossible to direct it and lead it to victory.
<H4>2. WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CHINA'S REVOLUTIONARY WAR?</H4>
<P>
What then are the characteristics of China's revolutionary war?
<P>
I think there are four principal ones.
<P>
The first is that China is a vast, semi-colonial country which is unevenly
developed politically and economically and which has gone through the revolution
of 1924-27.
<P>
This characteristic indicates that it is possible for China's revolutionary
war to develop and attain victory. We already pointed this out (at the First
Party Congress of the Hunan-Kiangsi Border Area)[<A href="#BM11">11</A>]
when in late 1927 and early 1928 soon after guerrilla warfare was started
in China, some comrades in the Chingkang Mountains in the Hunan-Kiangsi border
area raised the question, "How long can we keep the Red Flag flying?" For
this was a most fundamental question. Without answering this question of
whether China's revolutionary base areas and the Chinese Red Army could survive
and develop, we could not have advanced a single step. The Sixth National
Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 1928 again gave the answer to
the question. Since then the Chinese revolutionary movement has had a correct
theoretical basis.
<P>
Let us now analyse this characteristic.
<P>
China's political and economic development is uneven--a weak capitalist economy
coexists with a preponderant semi-feudal economy; a few modern industrial
and commercial cities coexist with a vast stagnant countryside; several million
industrial workers coexist with several hundred millions of peasants and
handicraftsmen labouring under the old system; big warlords controlling the
central government coexist with small warlords controlling the provinces;
two kinds of reactionary armies, the so-called Central Army under Chiang
Kai-shek and - miscellaneous troops" under the warlords in the provinces,
exist side by side; a<B> </B>few railways, steamship lines and motor roads
exist side by side with a vast number of wheelbarrow paths and foot-paths
many of which are difficult to negotiate even on foot.
<P>
China is a semi-colonial country--disunity among the imperialist powers makes
for disunity among the ruling groups in China. There is a difference between
a semi-colonial country controlled by several countries and a colony controlled
by a single country.
<P>
China is a vast country--"When it is dark in the east, it is light in the
west; when things are dark in the south, there is still light in the north."
Hence one need not worry about lack of room for manoeuvre.
<P>
China has gone through a great revolution--this has provided the seeds from
which the Red Army has grown, provided the leader of the Red Army, namely,
the Chinese Communist Party, and provided the masses with experience of
participation in a revolution.
<P>
We say, therefore, that the first characteristic of China's revolutionary
war is that it is waged in a vast semi-colonial country which is unevenly
developed politically and economically and which has gone through a revolution.
This characteristic basically determines our military strategy and tactics
as well as our political strategy and tactics.
<P>
The second characteristic is that our enemy is big and powerful.
<P>
How do matters stand with the Kuomintang, the enemy of the Red Army? It is
a party that has seized political power and has more or less stabilized its
power. It has gained the support of the world's principal counter-revolutionary
states. It has remodeled its army which has thus become different from any
other army in Chinese history and on the whole similar to the armies of modern
states; this army is much better supplied with weapons and <em>mat&eacute;riel
</em>than the Red Army, and is larger than any army in Chinese history, or
for that matter than the standing army of any other country. There is a world
of difference between the Kuomintang army and the Red Army. The Kuomintang
controls the key positions or lifelines in the politics, economy, communications
and culture of China; its political power is nation-wide.
<P>
The Chinese Red Army is thus confronted with a big and powerful enemy. This
is the second characteristic of China's revolutionary war. It necessarily
makes the military operations of the Red Army different in many ways from
those of wars in general and from those of the civil war in the Soviet Union
or of the Northern Expedition.
<P>
The third characteristic is that the Red Army is small and weak. The Chinese
Red Army, starting as guerrilla units, came into being after the defeat of
the first great revolution. This occurred in a period of relative political
and economic stability in the reactionary capitalist countries of the world
as well as in a period of reaction in China.
<P>
Our political power exists in scattered and isolated mountainous or remote
regions and receives no outside help whatsoever. Economic and cultural conditions
in the revolutionary base areas are backward compared with those in the
Kuomintang areas. The revolutionary base areas embrace only rural districts
and small towns. These areas were extremely small in the beginning and have
not grown much larger since. Moreover, they are fluid and not stationary,
and the Red Army has no really consolidated bases.
<P>
The Red Army is numerically small, its arms are poor, and it has great difficulty
in obtaining supplies such as food, bedding and clothing.
<P>
This characteristic presents a sharp contrast to the preceding one. Prom
this sharp contrast have arisen the strategy and tactics of the Red Army.
<P>
The fourth characteristic is Communist Party leadership and the agrarian
revolution.
<P>
This characteristic is the inevitable consequence of the first one. It has
given rise to two features. On the one hand, despite the fact that China's
revolutionary war is taking place in a period of reaction in China and throughout
the capitalist world, victory is possible because it is under the leadership
of the Communist Party and has the support of the peasantry. Thanks to this
support, our base areas, small as they are, are politically very powerful
and stand firmly opposed to the enormous Kuomintang regime, while militarily
they place great difficulties in the way of the Kuomintang attacks. Small
as it is, the Red Army has great fighting capacity, because its members,
led by the Communist Party, are born of the agrarian revolution and are fighting
for their own interests, and because its commanders and fighters are politically
united.
<P>
The Kuomintang, on the other hand, presents a sharp contrast. It opposes
the agrarian revolution and therefore has no support from the peasantry.
Though it has a large army, the Kuomintang cannot make its soldiers and the
many lower-ranking officers, who were originally small producers, risk their
lives willingly for it. Its officers and men are politically divided, which
reduces its fighting capacity.
<H4>3. OUR STRATEGY AND TACTICS ENSUING FROM THESE CHARACTERISTICS</H4>
<P>
Thus the four principal characteristics of China's revolutionary war are:
a vast semi-colonial country which is unevenly developed politically and
economically and which has gone through a great revolution; a big and powerful
enemy; a small and weak Red Army; and the agrarian revolution. These
characteristics determine the line for guiding China's revolutionary war
as well as many of its strategic and tactical principles. It follows from
the first and fourth characteristics that it is possible for the Chinese
Red Army to grow and defeat its enemy. It follows from the second and third
characteristics that it is impossible for the Chinese Red Army to grow very
rapidly or defeat its enemy quickly; in other words, the war will be protracted
and may even be lost if it is mishandled.
<P>
These are the two aspects of China's revolutionary war. They exist
simultaneously, that is, there are favourable factors and there are difficulties.
This is the fundamental law of China's revolutionary war, from which many
other laws ensue. The history of our ten years of war has proved the validity
of this law. He who has eyes but fails to see this fundamental law cannot
direct China's revolutionary war, cannot lead the Red Army to victories.
<P>
It is clear that we must correctly settle all the following matters of principle:
<P>
Determine our strategic orientation correctly, oppose adventurism when on
the offensive, oppose conservatism when on the defensive, and oppose flightism
when shifting from one place to another.
<P>
Oppose guerrilla-ism in the Red Army, while recognizing the guerrilla character
of its operations.
<P>
Oppose protracted campaigns and a strategy of quick decision, and uphold
the strategy of protracted war and campaigns of quick decision.
<P>
Oppose fixed battle lines and positional warfare, and favour<B> </B>fluid
battle lines and mobile warfare.
<P>
Oppose fighting merely to rout the enemy, and uphold fighting to annihilate
the enemy.
<P>
Oppose the strategy of striking with two "fists" in two directions at the
same time, and uphold the strategy of striking with one "fist" in one direction
at one time. [<A href="#BM12">12</A>]
<P>
Oppose the principle of maintaining one large rear area, and uphold the principle
of small rear areas.
<P>
Oppose an absolutely centralized command, and favour a relatively centralized
command.
<P>
Oppose the purely military viewpoint and the ways of roving rebels,
[<A href="#BM13">13</A>] and recognize that the Red Army is a propagandist
and organizer of the Chinese revolution.
<P>
Oppose bandit ways, [<A href="#BM14">14</A>] and uphold strict political
discipline.
<P>
Oppose warlord ways, and favour both democracy within proper limits and an
authoritative discipline in the army.
<P>
Oppose an incorrect, sectarian policy on cadres, and uphold the correct policy
on cadres.
<P>
Oppose the policy of isolation, and affirm the policy of winning over all
possible allies.
<P>
Oppose keeping the Red Army at its old stage, and strive to develop it to
a new stage.
<P>
Our present discussion of the problems of strategy is intended to elucidate
these matters carefully in the light of the historical experience gained
in China's ten years of bloody revolutionary war.
<H3><em>CHAPTER IV.</em></H3>
<H3>
  "ENCIRCLEMENT AND SUPPRESSION" AND COUNTER-CAMPAIGNS AGAINST IT --THE MAIN
  PATTERN OF CHINA'S CIVIL WAR
</H3>
<P>
In the ten years since our guerrilla war began, every independent Red guerrilla
unit, every Red Army unit or every revolutionary base area has been regularly
subjected by the enemy to "encirclement and suppression". The enemy looks
upon the Red Army as a monster and seeks to capture it the moment it shows
itself. He is for ever pursuing the Red Army and for ever trying to encircle
it. For ten years this pattern of warfare has not changed, and unless the
civil war gives place to a national war, the pattern will remain the same
till the day the enemy becomes the weaker contestant and the Red Army the
stronger.
<P>
The Red Army's operations take the form of counter-campaigns against
"encirclement and suppression". For us victory means chiefly victory in combating
"encirclement and suppression", that is, strategic victory and victories
in campaigns. The fight against each "encirclement and suppression" campaign
constitutes a counter-campaign, which usually comprises several or even scores
of battles, big and small. Until an "encirclement and suppression" campaign
has been basically smashed, one cannot speak of strategic victory or of victory
in the counter-campaign as a whole, even though many battles may have been
won. The history of the Red Army's decade of war is a history of
counter-campaigns against "encirclement and suppression".
<P>
In the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" campaigns and the Red Army's
counter-campaigns against them, the two forms of fighting, offensive and
defensive, are both employed, and here there is no difference from any other
war, ancient or modern, in China or elsewhere. The special characteristic
of China's civil war, however, is the repeated alternation of the two forms
over a long period of time. In each "encirclement and suppression" campaign,
the enemy employs the offensive against the Red Army's defensive, and the
Red Army employs the defensive against his offensive; this is the first stage
of a counter-campaign against "encirclement and suppression". Then the enemy
employs the defensive against the Red Army's offensive, and the Red Army
employs the offensive against his defensive; this is the second stage of
the counter-campaign. Every "encirclement and suppression" campaign has these
two stages, and they alternate over a long period.
<P>
By repeated alternation over a long period we mean the repetition of this
pattern of warfare and these forms of fighting. This is a fact obvious to
everybody. An "encirclement and suppression" campaign and a counter-campaign
against it--such is the repeated pattern of the war. In each campaign the
alternation in the forms of fighting consists of the first stage in which
the enemy employs the offensive against our defensive and we meet his offensive
with our defensive, and of the second stage in which the enemy employs the
defensive against our offensive and we meet his defensive with our offensive.
<P>
As for the content of a campaign or of a battle, it does not consist of mere
repetition but is different each time. This, too, is a fact and obvious to
everybody. In this connection it has become a rule that with each campaign
and each counter-campaign, the scale becomes larger, the situation more
complicated and the fighting more intense.
<P>
But this does not mean that there are no ups and downs. After the enemy's
fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign, the Red Army was greatly weakened,
and all the base areas in the south were lost. Having shifted to the northwest,
the Red Army now no longer holds a vital position threatening the internal
enemy as it did in the south and as a result the scale of the "encirclement
and suppression" campaigns has become smaller, the situation simpler and
the fighting less intense.
<P>
What constitutes a defeat for the Red Army? Strategically speaking, there
is a defeat only when a counter-campaign against "encirclement and suppression"
fails completely, but even then the defeat is only partial and temporary.
For only the total destruction of the Red Army would constitute complete
defeat in the civil war; but this has never happened. The loss of extensive
base areas and the shift of the Red Army constituted a temporary and partial
defeat, not a final and complete one, even though this partial defeat entailed
losing go per cent of the Party membership, of the armed forces and of the
base areas. We call this shift the continuation of our defensive and the
enemy's pursuit the continuation of his offensive. That is to say, in the
course of the struggle between the enemy's "encirclement and suppression"
and our counter-campaign we allowed our defensive to be broken by the enemy's
offensive instead of turning from the defensive to the offensive; and so
our defensive turned into a retreat and the enemy's offensive into a pursuit.
But when the Red Army reached a new area, as for example when we shifted
from Kiangsi Province and various other regions to Shensi Province, the
repetition of "encirclement and suppression" campaigns began afresh. That
is why we say that the Red Army's strategic retreat (the Long March) was
a continuation of its strategic defensive and the enemy's strategic pursuit
was a continuation of his strategic offensive.
<P>
In the Chinese civil war, as in all other wars, ancient or modern, in China
or abroad, there are only two basic forms of fighting, attack and defence.
The special characteristic of China's civil war consists in the long-term
repetition of "encirclement and suppression" campaigns and of our
counter-campaigns together with the long-term alternation in the two forms
of fighting, attack and defence, with the inclusion of the phenomenon of
the great strategic shift of more than ten thousand kilometres (the Long
March). [<A href="#BM15">15</A>]
<P>
A defeat for the enemy is much the same. It is a strategic defeat for the
enemy when his "encirclement and suppression" campaign is broken and our
defensive becomes an offensive, when the enemy turns to the defensive and
has to reorganize before launching another "encirclement and suppression"
campaign. The enemy has not had to make a strategic shift of more than ten
thousand kilometres such as we have, because he rules the whole country and
is much stronger than we are. But there have been partial shifts of his forces.
Sometimes, enemy forces in White strongholds encircled by the Red Army in
some base areas have broken through our encirclement and withdrawn to the
White areas to organize new offensives. If the civil war is prolonged and
the Red Army's victories become more extensive, there will be more of this
sort of thing. But the enemy cannot achieve the same results as the Red Army,
because he does not have the help of the people and because his officers
and men are not united. If he were to imitate the Red Army's long-distance
shift, he would certainly be wiped out.
<P>
In the period of the Li Li-san line in 1930, Comrade Li Li-san failed to
understand the protracted nature of China's civil war and for that reason
did not perceive the law that in the course of this war there is repetition
over a long period of "encirclement and suppression" campaigns and of their
defeat (by that time there had already been three in the Hunan-Kiangsi border
area and two in Fukien). Hence, in an attempt to achieve rapid victory for
the revolution, he ordered the Red Army, which was then still in its infancy,
to attack Wuhan, and also ordered a nation-wide armed uprising. Thus he committed
the error of "Left" opportunism.
<P>
Likewise the "Left" opportunists of 1931-1934 did not believe in the law
of the repetition of "encirclement and suppression" campaigns. Some responsible
comrades in our base area along the Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei border held an "auxiliary
force" theory, maintaining that the Kuomintang army had become merely an
auxiliary force after the defeat of its third "encirclement and suppression"
campaign and that the imperialists themselves would have to take the field
as the main force in further attacks on the Red Army. The strategy based
on this estimate was that the Red Army should attack Wuhan. In principle,
this fitted in with the views of those comrades in Kiangsi who called for
a Red Army attack on Nanchang, were against the work of linking up the base
areas and the tactics of luring the enemy in deep, regarded the seizure of
the capital and other key cities of a province as the starting point for
victory in that province, and held that "the fight against the fifth
'encirclement and suppression' campaign represents the decisive battle between
the road of revolution and the road of colonialism". This "Left" opportunism
was the source of the wrong line adopted in the struggles against the fourth
"encirclement and suppression" campaign in the Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei border
area and in those against the fifth in the Central Area in Kiangsi; and it
rendered the Red Army helpless before these fierce enemy campaigns and brought
enormous losses to the Chinese revolution.
<P>
The view that the Red Army should under no circumstances adopt defensive
methods was directly related to this "Left" opportunism which denied the
repetition of "encirclement and suppression" campaigns, and it, too, was
entirely erroneous.
<P>
The proposition that a revolution or a revolutionary war is an offensive
is of course correct. A revolution or a revolutionary war in its emergence
and growth from a small force to a big force, from the absence of political
power to the seizure of political power, from the absence of a Red Army to
the creation of a Red Army, and from the absence of revolutionary base areas
to their establishment must be on the offensive and cannot be conservative;
and tendencies towards conservatism must be opposed.
<P>
The only entirely correct proposition is that a revolution or a revolutionary
war is an offensive but also involves defence and retreat To defend in order
to attack, to retreat in order to advance, to move against the flanks in
order to move against the front, and to take a roundabout route in order
to get on to the direct route--this is inevitable in the process of development
of many phenomena, especially military movements.
<P>
Of the two propositions stated above, the first may be correct in the political
sphere, but it is incorrect when transposed to the military sphere. Moreover,
it is correct politically only in one situation (when the revolution is
advancing), but incorrect when transposed to another situation (when the
revolution is in retreat, in general retreat as in Russia in 1906,
[<A href="#BM16">16</A>] and in China in 1927 or in partial retreat as in
Russia at the time of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918).
[<A href="#BM17">17</A>] Only the second proposition is entirely correct
and true. The "Left" opportunism of 1931-34, which mechanically opposed the
employment of defensive military measures, was nothing but infantile thinking.
<P>
When will the pattern of repeated "encirclement and suppression" campaigns
come to an end? In my opinion, if the civil war is prolonged, this repetition
will cease when a fundamental change takes place in the balance of forces.
It will cease when the Red Army has become stronger than the enemy. Then
we shall be encircling and suppressing the enemy and he will be resorting
to counter-campaigns, but political and military conditions will not allow
him to attain the same position as that of the Red Army in its counter-campaigns.
It can be definitely asserted that by then the pattern of repeated "encirclement
and suppression" campaigns will have largely, if not completely, come to
an end.
<H3> <em>CHAPTER V</em></H3>
<H3>THE STRATEGIC DEFENSIVE</H3>
<P>
Under this heading I would like to discuss the following problems: (I) active
and passive defence; (2) preparations for combating "encirclement and
suppression" campaigns; (3) strategic retreat; (4) strategic counter-offensive;
(5) starting the counter-offensive; (6) concentration of troops; (7) mobile
warfare; (8) war of quick decision; and (9) war of annihilation.
<H4>1. ACTIVE AND PASSIVE DEFENCE</H4>
<P>
Why do we begin by discussing defence? After the failure of China's first
national united front of 1994-27, the revolution became a most intense and
ruthless class war. While the enemy ruled the whole country, we had only
small armed forces; consequently, from the very beginning we have had to
wage a bitter struggle against his "encirclement and suppression" campaigns.
Our offensives have been closely linked with our efforts to break them, and
our fate depends entirely on whether or not we are able to do so. The process
of breaking an "encirclement and suppression" campaign is usually circuitous
and not as direct as one would wish. The primary problem, and a serious one
too, is how to conserve our strength and await an opportunity to defeat the
enemy. Therefore, the strategic defensive is the most complicated and most
important problem facing the Red Army in its operations.
<P>
In our ten years of war two deviations often arose with regard to the strategic
defensive; one was to belittle the enemy, the other was to be terrified of
him.
<P>
As a result of belittling the enemy, many guerrilla units suffered defeat,
and on several occasions the Red Army was unable to break the enemy's
"encirclement and suppression".
<P>
When the revolutionary guerrilla units first came into existence, their leaders
often failed to assess the enemy's situation and our own correctly. Because
they had been successful in organizing sudden armed uprisings in certain
places or mutinies among the White troops, they saw only the momentarily
favourable circumstances, or failed to see the grave situation actually
confronting them, and so usually underestimated the enemy. Moreover, they
had no understanding of their own weaknesses (i.e., lack of experience and
smallness of forces). It was an objective fact that the enemy was strong
and we were weak, and yet some people refused to give it thought, talked
only of attack but never of defence or retreat, thus mentally disarming
themselves In the matter of defence, and hence misdirected their actions.
Many guerrilla units were defeated on this account.
<P>
Examples in which the Red Army, for this reason, failed to break the enemy's
"encirclement and suppression" campaigns were its defeat In 1928 in the
Haifeng-Lufeng area of Kwangtung Province, [<A HREF="#BM18">18</A>] and its
loss of freedom of action in 1932, in the fourth counter-campaign against
the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" in the Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei border
area, where the Red Army acted on the theory that the Kuomintang army was
merely an auxiliary force.
<P>
There are many instances of setbacks which were due to being terrified of
the enemy.
<P>
As against those who underestimated him, some people greatly overestimated
him and also greatly underestimated our own strength, as a result of which
they adopted an unwarranted policy of retreat and likewise disarmed themselves
mentally in the matter of defence. This resulted in the defeat of some guerrilla
units, or the failure of certain Red Army campaigns, or the loss of base
areas.
<P>
The most striking example of the loss of a base area was that of the Central
Base Area in Kiangsi during the fifth counter-campaign against "encirclement
and suppression". The mistake here arose from a Rightist viewpoint. The leaders
feared the enemy as if he were a tiger, set up defences everywhere, fought
defensive actions at every step and did not dare to advance to the enemy's
rear and attack him there, which would have been to our advantage, or boldly
to lure the enemy troops in deep so as to herd them together and annihilate
them. As a result, the whole base area was lost and the Red Army had to undertake
the Long March of over 12,000 kilometres. However, this kind of mistake was
usually preceded by a "Left" error of underestimating the enemy. The military
adventurism of attacking the key cities in 1932 was the root cause of the
line of passive defence subsequently adopted in coping with the enemy's fifth
"encirclement and suppression" campaign.
<P>
<P>
The most extreme example of being terrified of the enemy was the retreatism
of the "Chang Kuo-tao line". The defeat of the Western Column of the Fourth
Front Red Army west of the Yellow River [<A href="#BM19">19</A>] marked the
final bankruptcy of this line.
<P>
<P>
Active defence is also known as offensive defence, or defence through decisive
engagements. Passive defence is also known as purely defensive defence or
pure defence. Passive defence is actually a spurious kind of defence, and
the only real defence is active defence, defence for the purpose of
counter-attacking and taking the offensive. As far as I know, there is no
military manual of value nor any sensible military expert, ancient or modern,
Chinese or foreign, that does not oppose passive defence, whether in strategy
or tactics. Only a complete fool or a madman would cherish passive defence
as a talisman. However, there are people in this world who do such things.
That is an error in war, a manifestation of conservatism in military matters,
which we must resolutely oppose.
<P>
The military experts of the newer and rapidly developing imperialist countries,
namely, Germany and Japan, trumpet the advantages of the strategic offensive
and come out against the strategic defensive. This kind of military thinking
is absolutely unsuited to China's revolutionary war. These military experts
assert that a serious weakness of the defensive is that it shakes popular
morale, instead of inspiring it. This applies to countries where class
contradictions are acute and the war benefits only the reactionary ruling
strata or the reactionary political groups in power. But our situation is
different. With the slogan of defending the revolutionary base areas and
defending China, we can rally the overwhelming majority of the people to
fight with one heart and one mind, because we are the oppressed and the victims
of aggression. It was also by using the form of the defensive that the Red
Army of the Soviet Union defeated its enemies during the civil war. When
the imperialist countries organized the Whites for attack, the war was waged
under the slogan of defending the Soviets, even when the October Uprising
was being prepared, the military mobilization was carried out under the slogan
of defending the capital. In every just war the defensive not only has a
lulling effect on politically alien elements, it also makes possible the
rallying of the backward sections of the masses to join in the war.
<P>
When Marx said that once an armed uprising is started there must not be a
moment's pause in the attack, [<A href="#BM20">20</A>] he meant that the
masses having taken the enemy unawares in an insurrection, must give the
reactionary rulers no chance to retain or recover their political power must
seize this moment to beat the nation's reactionary ruling forces when they
are unprepared, and must not rest content with the victories already won,
underestimate the enemy, slacken their attacks or hesitate to press forward,
and so let slip the opportunity of destroying the enemy, bringing failure
to the revolution. This is correct. It does not mean, however, that when
we are already locked in battle with an enemy who enjoys superiority, we
revolutionaries should not adopt defensive measures even when we are hard
pressed. Only a prize idiot would think in this way.
<P>
<P>
Taken as a whole, our war has been an offensive against the Kuomintang, but
militarily it has assumed the form of breaking the enemy's "encirclement
and suppression".
<P>
<P>
Militarily speaking, our warfare consists of the alternate use of the defensive
and the offensive. In our case it makes no difference whether the offensive
is said to follow or to precede the defensive, because the crux of the matter
is to break the "encirclement and suppression". The defensive continues until
an "encirclement and suppression" campaign is broken, whereupon the offensive
begins, these being but two stages of the same thing; and one such enemy
campaign is closely followed by another. Of the two stages, the defensive
is the more complicated and the more important. It involves numerous problems
of how to break the "encirclement and suppression". The basic principle here
is to stand for active defence and oppose passive defence.
<P>
In our civil war, when the strength of the Red Army surpasses that of the
enemy, we shall, in general, no longer need the strategic defensive Our policy
then will be the strategic offensive alone. This change will depend on an
over-all change in the balance of forces. By that time the only remaining
defensive measures will be of a partial character.
<H4>2. PREPARATIONS FOR COMBATING "ENCIRCLEMENT AND SUPPRESSION" CAMPAIGNS</H4>
<P>
Unless we have made necessary and sufficient preparations against a planned
enemy "encirclement and suppression" campaign, we shall certainly be forced
into a passive position. To accept battle in haste is to fight without being
sure of victory. Therefore, when the enemy is preparing an "encirclement
and suppression" campaign, it is absolutely necessary for us to prepare our
counter-campaign. To be opposed to such preparations, as some people in our
ranks were at one time, is childish and ridiculous.
<P>
There is a difficult problem here on which controversy may easily arise.
When should we conclude our offensive and switch to the phase of preparing
our counter-campaign against "encirclement and suppression"? When we are
victoriously on the offensive and the enemy is on the defensive, his preparations
for the next "encirclement and suppression" campaign are conducted in secret,
and therefore it is difficult for us to know when his offensive will begin.
If our work of preparing the counter-campaign begins too early, it is bound
to reduce the gains from our offensive and will sometimes even have certain
harmful effects on the Red Army and the people. For the chief measures in
the preparatory phase are the military preparations for withdrawal and the
political mobilization for them. Sometimes, if we start preparing too early,
this will turn into waiting for the enemy; after waiting a long time without
the enemy's appearing, we will have to renew our offensive. And sometimes,
the enemy will start his offensive just as our new offensive is beginning,
thus putting us in a difficult position. Hence the choice of the right moment
to begin our preparations is an important problem. The right moment should
be determined with due regard both to the enemy's situation and our own and
to the relation between the two. In order to know the enemy's situation,
we should collect information on his political, military and financial position
and the state of public opinion in his territory. In analysing such information
we must take the total strength of the enemy into full account and must not
exaggerate the extent of his past defeats, but on the other hand we must
not fail to take into account his internal contradictions, his financial
difficulties, the effect of his past defeats, etc. As for our side, we must
not exaggerate the extent of our past victories, but neither should we fail
to take full account of their effect. \
<P>
Generally speaking, however, the question of timing the preparations, it
is preferable to start them too early rather than too late. For the former
involves smaller losses and has the advantage that preparedness averts peril
and puts us in a fundamentally invincible position.
<P>
The essential problems during the preparatory phase are the preparations
for the withdrawal of the Red Army, political mobilization, recruitment,
arrangements for finance and provisions, and the handling of politically
alien elements.
<P>
By preparations for the Red Army's withdrawal we mean taking care that it
does not move in a direction jeopardizing the withdrawal or advance too far
in its attacks or become too fatigued. These are the things the main forces
of the Red Army must attend to on the eve of a large-scale enemy offensive.
At such a time, the Red Army must devote its attention mainly to planning
the selection and preparation of the battle areas, the acquisition of supplies,
and the enlargement and training of its own forces.
<P>
Political mobilization is a problem of prime importance in the struggle against
"encirclement and suppression". That is to say, we should tell the Red Army
and the people in the base area clearly, resolutely and fully that the enemy's
offensive is inevitable and imminent and will do serious harm to the people,
but at the same time, we should tell them about his weaknesses, the factors
favourable to the Red Army, our indomitable will to victory and our general
plan of work. We should call upon the Red Army and the entire population
to fight against the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" campaign and
defend the base area. Except where military secrets are concerned, political
mobilization must be carried out openly, and, what is more, every effort
should be made to extend it to all who might possibly support the revolutionary
cause. The key link here is to convince the cadres.
<P>
Recruitment of new soldiers should be based on two considerations, first,
on the level of political consciousness of the people and the size of the
population and, second, on the current state of the Red Army and the possible
extent of its losses in the whole course of the counter-campaign.
<P>
Needless to say, the problems of finance and food are of great importance
to the counter-campaign. We must take the possibility of a prolonged enemy
campaign into account. It is necessary to make an estimate of the minimum
material requirements--chiefly of the Red Army but also of the people in
the revolutionary base area-- for the entire struggle against the enemy's
"encirclement and suppression" campaign.
<P>
With regard to politically alien elements we should not be off our guard,
but neither should we be unduly apprehensive of treachery on their part and
adopt excessive precautionary measures. Distinction should be made between
the landlords, the merchants and the rich peasants, and the main point is
to explain things to them politically and win their neutrality, while at
the same time organizing the masses of the people to keep an eye on them.
Only against the very few elements who are most dangerous should stern measures
like arrest be taken.
<P>
The extent of success in a struggle against "encirclement and suppression"
is closely related to the degree to which the tasks of the preparatory phase
have been fulfilled. Relaxation of preparatory work which is due to
underestimation of the enemy and panic which is due to being terrified of
the enemy's attacks are harmful tendencies, and both should be resolutely
opposed. What we need is an enthusiastic but calm state of mind and intense
but orderly work.
<H4>3. STRATEGIC RETREAT</H4>
<P>
A strategic retreat is a planned strategic step taken by an inferior force
for the purpose of conserving its strength and biding its time to defeat
the enemy, when it finds itself confronted with a superior force whose offensive
it is unable to smash quickly. But military adventurists stubbornly oppose
such a step and advocate "engaging the enemy outside the gates".
<P>
We all know that when two boxers fight, the clever boxer usually gives a
little ground at first, while the foolish one rushes in furiously and uses
up all his resources at the very start, and in the end he is often beaten
by the man who has given ground.
<P>
In the novel <em>Shui Hu Chuan, [<A href="#BM21">21</A>] </em>the drill master
Hung, challenging Lin Chung to a fight on Chai Chin's estate, shouts, "Come
on! Come on ! Come on !" In the end it is the retreating Lin Chung who spots
Hung's weak point and floors him with one blow.
<P>
During the Spring and Autumn Era, when the states of Lu and Chi
[<A href="#BM22">22</A>] were at war, Duke Chuang of Lu wanted to attack
before the Chi troops had tired themselves out, but Tsao Kuei prevented him.
When instead he adopted the tactic of "the enemy tires, we attack", he defeated
the Chi army. This is a classic example from China's military history of
a weak force defeating a strong force. Here is the account given by the historian
Tsochiu Ming: [<A href="#BM23">23</A>]
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  In the spring the Chi troops invaded us. The Duke was about to fight. Tsao
  Kuei requested an audience. His neighbours said,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "This is the business of meat-eating officials, why meddle with it?" Tsao
  replied, "Meat-eaters are fools, they cannot plan ahead." So he saw the Duke.
  And he asked, "What will you rely on when you fight?" The Duke answered,
  "I never dare to keep all my food and clothing for my own enjoyment, but
  always share them with others." Tsao said, "Such paltry charity cannot reach
  all The people will not follow you." The Duke said, "I never offer to the
  gods less sacrificial beasts, jade or silk than are due to them. I keep good
  faith." Tsao said, "Such paltry faith wins no trust. The gods will not bless
  you." The Duke said, "Though unable personally to attend to the details of
  all trials, big and small, I always demand the facts." Tsao said, "That shows
  your devotion to your people. You can give battle. When you do so, I beg
  to follow you." The Duke and he rode in the same chariot. The battle was
  joined at Changshao. When the Duke was about to sound the drum for the attack,
  Tsao said, "Not yet." When the men of Chi had drummed thrice, Tsao said,
  "Now we can drum" The army of Chi was routed. The Duke wanted to pursue.
  Again Tsao said, "Not yet." He got down from the chariot to examine the enemy's
  wheel-tracks, then mounted the arm-rest of the chariot to look afar. He said,
  "Now we can pursue!" So began the pursuit of the Chi troops. After the victory
  the Duke asked Tsao why he had given such advice. Tsao replied, "A battle
  depends upon courage. At the first drum courage is aroused, at the second
  it flags, and with the third it runs out. When the enemy's courage ran out,
  ours was still high and so we won. It is difficult to fathom the moves of
  a great state, and I feared an ambush. But when I examined the enemy's
  wheel-tracks and found them cries-crossing and looked afar and saw his banners
  drooping, I advised pursuit."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
That was a case of a weak state resisting a strong state The story speaks
of the political preparations before a battle--winning the confidence of
the people; it speaks of a battlefield favourable for<B> </B>switching over
to the counter- offensive--Changshao, it indicates the favourable time for
starting the counter-offensive--when the enemy's courage is running out and
one's own is high; and it points to the moment for starting the pursuit--when
the enemy's tracks are crisscrossed and his banners are drooping. Though
the battle was not a big one, it illustrates the principles of the strategic
defensive. China's military history contains numerous instances of victories
won on these principles. In such famous battles as the Battle of Chengkao
between the states of Chu and Han, [<A href="#BM24">24</A>] the Battle of
Kunyang between the states of Hsin and Han, [<A href="#BM25">25</A>] the
Battle of Kuantu between Yuan Shao and Tsao Tsao, [<A href="#BM26">26</A>]
the Battle of Chipi between the states of Wu and Wei,
[<A href="#BM27">27</A>] the Battle of Yiling between the states of Wu and
Shu, [<A href="#BM28">28</A>] and the Battle of Feishui between the states
of Chin and Tsin, [<A href="#BM29">29</A>] in each case the contending sides
were unequal, and the weaker side, yielding some ground at first, gained
mastery by striking only after the enemy had struck and so defeated the stronger
side.
<P>
Our war began in the autumn of 1927, and we then had no experience at all.
The Nanchang Uprising [<A href="#BM30">30</A>] and the Canton Uprising
[<A href="#BM31">31</A>] failed, and in the Autumn Harvest Uprising
[<A href="#BM32">32</A>] the Red Army in the Hunan-Hupeh-Kiangsi border area
also suffered several defeats and shifted to the Chingkang Mountains on the
Hunan-Kiangsi border. In the following April the units which had survived
the defeat of the Nanchang Uprising also moved to the Chingkang Mountains
by way of southern Hunan. By May 1928 however, basic principles of guerrilla
warfare, simple in nature and suited to the conditions of the time, had already
been evolved, that is, the sixteen-character formula: "The enemy advances,
we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy
retreats, we pursue." This sixteen-character formulation of military principles
was accepted by the Central Committee before the Li Li-san line. Later our
operational principles were developed a step further. At the time of our
first counter-campaign against "encirclement and suppression" in the Kiangsi
base area, the principle of "luring the enemy in deep" was put forward and,
moreover, successfully applied. By the time the enemy's third "encirclement
and suppression" campaign was defeated, a complete set of operational principles
for the Red Army had taken shape. This marked a new stage in the development
of our military principles, which were greatly enriched in content and underwent
many changes in form, mainly in the sense that although they basically remained
the same as in the sixteen-character formula, they transcended their originally
simple nature. The sixteen-character formula covered the basic principles
for combating "encirclement and suppression"; it covered the two stages of
the strategic defensive and the strategic offensive, and within the defensive,
it covered the two stages of the strategic retreat and the strategic
counter-offensive. What came later was only a development of this formula.
<P>
But beginning from January 1932, after the publication of the Party's resolution
entitled "Struggle for Victory First in One or More Provinces After Smashing
the Third 'Encirclement and Suppression' Campaign", which contained serious
errors of principle, the "Left" opportunists attacked these correct principles,
finally abrogated the whole set and instituted a complete set of contrary
"new principles" or "regular principles". From then on, the old principles
were no longer to be considered as regular but were to be rejected as
"guerrilla-ism". The opposition to "guerrilla-ism" reigned for three whole
years. Its first stage was military adventurism, in the second it turned
into military conservatism and, finally, in the third stage it became flightism.
It was not until the Central Committee held the enlarged meeting of the Political
Bureau at Tsunyi, Kweichow Province, in January 1935 that this wrong line
was declared bankrupt and the correctness of the old line reaffirmed. But
at what a cost!
<P>
Those comrades who vigorously opposed "guerrilla-ism" argued along the following
lines. It was wrong to lure the enemy in deep because we had to abandon so
much territory. Although battles had been won in this way, was not the situation
different now? Moreover, was it not better to defeat the enemy without abandoning
territory? And was it not better still to defeat the enemy in his own areas,
or on the borders between his areas and ours? The old practices had nothing
"regular" about them and were methods used only by guerrillas. Now our own
state had been established and our Red Army had become a regular army. Our
fight against Chiang Kai-shek had become a war between two states, between
two great armies. History should not repeat itself, and everything pertaining
to "guerrilla-ism" should be totally discarded. The new principles were
"completely Marxist", while the old had been created by guerrilla units in
the mountains, and there was no Marxism in the mountains. The new principles
were the antithesis of the old. They were: "Pit one against ten, pit ten
against a hundred, fight bravely and determinedly, and exploit victories
by hot pursuit"; "Attack on all fronts"; "Seize key cities"; and "Strike
with two 'fists' in two directions at the same time". When the enemy attacked,
the methods of dealing with him were: "Engage the enemy outside the gates",
"Gain mastery by striking first", "Don't let our pots and pans be smashed",
"Don't give up an inch of territory" and "Divide the forces into six routes".
The war was "the decisive battle between the road of revolution and the road
of colonialism", a war of short swift thrusts, blockhouse warfare, war of
attrition, "protracted war". There were, further, the policy of maintaining
a great rear area and an absolutely centralized command. Finally there was
a large-scale "house-moving". And anyone who did not accept these things
was to be punished, labelled an opportunist, and so on and so forth.
<P>
Without a doubt these theories and practices were all wrong. They were nothing
but subjectivism. Under favourable circumstances this subjectivism manifested
itself in petty-bourgeois revolutionary fanaticism and impetuosity, but in
times of adversity, as the situation worsened, it changed successively into
desperate recklessness, conservatism and flightism. They were the theories
and practices of hotheads and ignoramuses; they did not have the slightest
flavour of Marxism about them; indeed they were anti-Marxist.
<P>
Here we shall discuss only strategic retreat, which in Kiangsi was called
"luring the enemy in deep" and in Szechuan "contracting the front". No previous
theorist or practitioner of war has ever denied that this is the policy a
weak army fighting a strong army must adopt in the initial stage of a war.
It has been said by a foreign military expert that in strategically defensive
operations, decisive battles are usually avoided in the beginning, and are
sought only when conditions have become favourable. That is entirely correct
and we have nothing to add to it.
<P>
The object of strategic retreat is to conserve military strength and prepare
for the counter-offensive. Retreat is necessary because not to retreat a
step before the onset of a strong enemy inevitably means to jeopardize the
preservation of one's own forces. In the past, however, many people were
stubbornly opposed to retreat, considering it to be an "opportunist line
of pure defence". Our history has proved that their opposition was entirely
wrong.
<P>
To prepare for a counter-offensive, we must select or create conditions
favourable to ourselves but unfavourable to the enemy, so as to bring about
a change in the balance of forces, before we go on to the stage of the
counter-offensive.
<P>
In the light of our past experience, during the stage of retreat we should
in general secure at least two of the following conditions before we can
consider the situation as being favourable to us and unfavourable to the
enemy and before we can go over to the counter-offensive. These conditions
are:
<P>
(1) The population actively supports the Red Army.
<P>
(2) The terrain is favourable for operations.
<P>
(3) All the main forces of the Red Army are concentrated.
<P>
(4) The enemy's weak spots have been discovered.
<P>
(5) The enemy has been reduced to a tired and demoralized state).
<P>
(6) The enemy has been induced to make mistakes.
<P>
The first condition, active support of the population, is the most important
one for the Red Army. It means having a base area. Moreover, given this
condition, it is easy to achieve conditions 4, 5 and 6. Therefore, when the
enemy launches a full-scale offensive, the Red Army generally withdraws from
the White area into the base area, because that is where the population is
most active in supporting the Red Army against the White army. Also, there
is a difference between the borders and the central district of a base area;
in the latter the people are better at blocking the passage of information
to the enemy, better at reconnaissance, transportation, joining in the fighting,
and so on. Thus when we were combating the first, second and third "encirclement
and suppression" campaigns in Kiangsi, all the places selected as "terminal
points for the retreat" were situated where the first condition, popular
support, was excellent or quite good. This characteristic of our base areas
made the Red Army's operations very different from ordinary operations and
was the main reason why the enemy subsequently had to resort to the policy
of blockhouse warfare.
<P>
One advantage of operating on interior lines is that it makes it possible
for the retreating army to choose terrain favourable to itself and<B> </B>force
the attacking army to fight on its terms. In order to defeat a strong army,
a weak army must carefully choose favourable terrain as a battleground. But
this condition alone is not enough and must be accompanied by others. The
first of these is popular support. The next is a vulnerable enemy, for instance,
an enemy who is tired or has made mistakes, or an advancing enemy column
that is comparatively poor in fighting capacity. In the absence of these
conditions, even if we have found excellent terrain, we have to disregard
it and continue to retreat in order to secure them. In the White areas there
is no lack of good terrain, but we do not have the favourable condition of
active popular support. If other conditions are not yet fulfilled, the Red
Army has no alternative but to retreat towards its base area. Distinctions
such as those between the White areas and the Red areas also usually exist
between the borders and the central district of a base area.
<P>
Except for local units and containing forces, all our assault troops should,
on principle, be concentrated. When attacking an enemy who is on the defensive
strategically, the Red Army usually disperses its own forces. Once the enemy
launches a full-scale offensive, the Red Army effects a "retreat towards
the centre". The terminal point chosen for the retreat is usually in the
central section of the base area, but sometimes it is in the frontal or rear
sections, as circumstances require. By such a retreat towards the centre
all the main forces of the Red Army can be concentrated.
<P>
Another essential condition for a weak army fighting a strong one is to pick
out the enemy's weaker units for attack. But at the beginning of the enemy's
offensive we usually do not know which of his advancing columns is the strongest
and which the second strongest, which is the weakest and which the second
weakest, and so a process of reconnaissance is required. This often takes
a considerable time. That is another reason why strategic retreat is necessary.
<P>
If the attacking enemy is far more numerous and much stronger than we are,
we can accomplish a change in the balance of forces only when the enemy has
penetrated deeply into our base area and tasted all the bitterness it holds
for him. As the chief of staff of one of Chiang Kai-shek's brigades remarked
during the third "encirclement and suppression'! campaign, "Our stout men
have worn themselves thin and our thin men have worn themselves to death."
Or, in the words of Chen Ming-shu, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route
of the Kuomintang's "Encirclement and Suppression" Army, "Everywhere the
National Army gropes in the dark, while the Red Army walks in broad daylight."
By then the enemy army, although still strong, is much weakened, its soldiers
are tired, its morale is sagging and many of its weak spots are revealed.
But the Red Army, though weak, has conserved its strength and stored up its
energy, and is waiting at its ease for the fatigued enemy. At such a time
it is generally possible to attain a certain parity between the two sides,
or to change the enemy's absolute superiority to relative superiority and
our absolute inferiority to relative inferiority, and occasionally even to
become superior to the enemy. When fighting against the third "encirclement
and suppression" campaign in Kiangsi, the Red Army executed a retreat to
the extreme limit (to concentrate in the rear section of the base area);
if it had not done so, it could not have defeated the enemy because the enemy's
"encirclement and suppression" forces were then over ten times the size of
the Red Army. When Sun Wu Tzu said, "Avoid the enemy when he is full of vigour,
strike when he is fatigued and withdraws", he was referring to tiring and
demoralizing the enemy so as to reduce his superiority.
<P>
Finally, the object of retreat is to induce the enemy to make mistakes or
to detect his mistakes. One must realize that an enemy commander, however
wise, cannot avoid making some mistakes over a relatively long period of
time, and hence it is always possible for us to exploit the openings he leaves
us. The enemy is liable to make mistakes, just as we ourselves sometimes
miscalculate and give him openings to exploit. In addition, we can induce
the enemy to make mistakes by our own actions, for instance, by "counterfeiting
an appearance", as Sun Wu Tzu called it, that is, by making a feint to the
east but attacking in the west. If we are to do this, the terminal point
for the retreat cannot be rigidly limited to a definite area. Sometimes when
we have retreated to the predetermined area and not yet found openings to
exploit, we have to retreat farther and wait for the enemy to give us an
opening.
<P>
The favourable conditions which we seek by retreating are in general those
stated above. But this does not mean that a counter-offensive cannot be launched
until all these conditions are present. The presence of all of them at the
same time is neither possible nor necessary. But a weak force operating on
interior lines against a strong enemy should strive to secure such conditions
as are necessary in the light of the enemy's actual situation. All views
to the contrary are incorrect.
<P>
The decision on the terminal point for retreat should depend on the situation
as a whole. It is wrong to decide on a place which, considered in relation
to only part of the situation, appears to be favourable for our passing to
the counter-offensive, if it is not also advantageous from the point of view
of the situation as a whole. For at the start of our counter- offensive we
must take subsequent developments into consideration, and our counter-offensives
always begin on a partial scale. Sometimes the terminal point for retreat
should be fixed in the frontal section of the base area, as it was during
our second and fourth counter-campaigns against "encirclement and suppression"
in Kiangsi and our third counter-campaign in the Shensi-Kansu area. At times
it should be in the middle section of the base area, as in our first
counter-campaign in Kiangsi. At other times, it should be fixed in the rear
section of the base area, as in our third counter-campaign in Kiangsi. In
all these cases the decision was taken by correlating the partial situation
with the situation as a whole. But during the fifth counter-campaign in Kiangsi,
our army gave no consideration whatsoever to retreat, because it did not
take account of either the partial or the total situation, and this was really
rash and foolhardy conduct. A situation is made up of a number of factors;
in considering the relation between a part of the situation and the whole,
we should base our judgements on whether the factors on the enemy's side
and on ours, as manifested in both the partial and the whole situation, are
to a certain extent favourable for our starting a counter-offensive.
<P>
The terminal points for retreat in a base area can be generally divided into
three types, those in the frontal, those in the middle, and those in the
rear section of the base area. Does this, however, mean refusing to fight
in the White areas altogether? No. It is only when we have to deal with a
large-scale campaign of enemy "encirclement and suppression" that we refuse
to fight in the White areas. It is only when there is a wide disparity between
the enemy's strength and ours that, acting on the principle of conserving
our strength and biding our time to defeat the enemy, we advocate retreating
to the base area and luring him in deep, for only by so doing can we create
or find conditions favourable for our counter-offensive. If the situation
is not so serious, or if it is so serious that the Red Army cannot begin
its counter-offensive even in the base area, or if the counter-offensive
is not going well and a further retreat is necessary to bring about a change
in the situation, then we should recognize, theoretically at least, that
the terminal point for the retreat may be fixed in a White area, though we
have had very little experience of this kind.
<P>
In general, the terminal points for retreat in a White area can also be divided
into three types: (1) those in front of our base area, (2) those on its flanks,
and (3) those behind it. Here is an example of the first type.
<P>
During our first counter-campaign against "encirclement and suppression"
in Kiangsi, had it not been for the disunity inside the Red Army and the
split in the local Party organization (the two difficult problems created
by the Li Li-san line and the A-B Group), [<A href="#BM33">33</A>] it is
conceivable that we might have concentrated our forces within the triangle
formed by Kian, Nanfeng and Changshu and launched a counter-offensive. For
the enemy force advancing from the area between the Kan and Fu Rivers was
not very greatly superior to the Red Army in strength (100,000 against 40,000).
Though the popular support there was not as active as in the base area, the
terrain was favourable; moreover, it would have been possible to smash, one
by one, the enemy forces advancing along separate routes.
<P>
Now for an example of the second type.
<P>
During our third counter-campaign in Kiangsi, if the enemy's offensive had
not been on so large a scale, if one of the enemy's columns had advanced
from Chienning, Lichuan and Taining on the Fukien-Kiangsi border, and if
that column had not been too strong for us to attack, it is likewise conceivable
that the Red Army might have massed its forces in the White area in western
Fukien and crushed that column first, without having to make a thousand-li
detour through Juichin to Hsingkuo.
<P>
Finally, an example of the third type.
<P>
During that same third counter-campaign in Kiangsi, if the enemy's main force
had headed south instead of west, we might have been compelled to withdraw
to the Huichang-Hsunwu-Anyuan area (a White area), in order to induce the
enemy to move further south; the Red Army could have then driven northward
into the interior of the base area, by which time the enemy force in the
north of the base area would not have been very large.
<P>
The above, however, are all hypothetical examples not based on actual experience;
they should be regarded as exceptional and not treated as general principles.
When the enemy launches a large-scale "encirclement and suppression" campaign,
our general principle is to lure him in deep, withdraw into the base area
and fight him there, because this is our surest method of smashing his offensive.
<P>
Those who advocate "engaging the enemy outside the gates" oppose strategic
retreat, arguing that to retreat means to lose territory, to bring harm on
the people ("to let our pots and pans be smashed", as they call it), and
to give rise to unfavourable repercussions outside. During our fifth
counter-campaign, they argued that every time we retreated a step the enemy
would push his blockhouses forward a step, so that our base areas would
continuously shrink and we would have no way of recovering lost ground. Even
though luring the enemy deep into our territory might have been useful in
the past, it would be useless against the enemy's fifth "encirclement and
suppression" campaign in which he adopted the policy of blockhouse warfare.
The only way to deal with this campaign, they said, was to divide up our
forces for resistance and make short swift thrusts at the enemy.
<P>
It is easy to give an answer to such views, and our history has already done
so. As for loss of territory, it often happens that only by loss can loss
be avoided; this is the principle of "Give in order to take". If what we
lose is territory and what we gain is victory over the enemy, plus recovery
and also expansion of our territory, then it is a paying proposition. In
a business transaction, if a buyer does not "lose" some money, he cannot
obtain goods; if a seller does not "lose" some goods, he cannot obtain money.
The losses incurred in a revolutionary movement involve destruction, and
what is gained is construction of a progressive character. Sleep and rest
involve loss of time, but energy is gained for tomorrow's work. If any fool
does not understand this and refuses to sleep, he will have no energy the
next day, and that is a losing proposition. We lost out in the fifth
counter-campaign for precisely such reasons. Reluctance to give up part of
our territory resulted in the loss of it all. Abyssinia, too, lost all her
territory when she fought the enemy head-on, though that was not the sole
cause of her defeat.
<P>
The same holds true on the question of bringing damage on the people. If
you refuse to let the pots and pans of some households be smashed over a
short period of time, you will cause the smashing of the pots and pans of
all the people to go on over a long period of time. If you are afraid of
unfavourable short-term political repercussions, you will have to pay the
price in unfavourable long-term political repercussions. After the October
Revolution, if the Russian Bolsheviks had acted on the opinions of the "Left
Communists" and refused to sign the peace treaty with Germany, the new-born
Soviets would have been in danger of early death. [<A href="#BM34">34</A>]
<P>
Such seemingly revolutionary "Left" opinions originate from the revolutionary
impetuosity of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals as well as from the narrow
conservatism of the peasant small producers. People holding such opinions
look at problems only one-sidedly and are unable to take a comprehensive
view of the situation as a whole; they are unwilling to link the interests
of today with those of tomorrow or the interests of the part with those of
the whole, but cling like grim death to the partial and the temporary. Certainly,
we should cling tenaciously to the partial and the temporary when, in the
concrete circumstances of the time, they are favourable--and especially when
they are decisive--for the whole current situation and the whole period,
or otherwise we shall become advocates of letting things slide and doing
nothing about them. That is why a retreat must have a terminal point. We
must not go by<B> </B>the short-sightedness of the small producer. We should
learn the wisdom of the Bolsheviks. The naked eye is not enough, we must
have the aid of the telescope and the microscope The Marxist method is our
telescope and microscope in political and military matters.
<P>
Of course, strategic retreat has its difficulties. To pick the time for beginning
the retreat, to select the terminal point, to convince the cadres and the
people politically--these are difficult problems demanding solution.
<P>
The problem of timing the beginning of the retreat is very important. If
in the course of our first counter-campaign against "encirclement and
suppression" in Kiangsi Province our retreat had not been carried out just
when it was, that is, if it had been delayed, then at the very least the
extent of our victory would have been affected. Both a premature and a belated
retreat, of course, bring losses. But generally speaking, a belated retreat
brings more losses than a premature one. A well-timed retreat, which enables
us to keep all the initiative, is of great assistance to us in switching
to the counter-offensive when, having reached the terminal point for our
retreat, we have regrouped our forces and are waiting at our ease for the
fatigued enemy. When smashing the enemy's first, second and fourth campaigns
of "encirclement and suppression" in Kiangsi, we were able to handle him
confidently and without haste. It was only during the third campaign that
the Red Army was very fatigued by the detour it had hastily had to make m
order to reassemble, because we had not expected the enemy to launch a new
offensive so quickly after suffering such a crushing defeat in the second
campaign (we ended our second counter-campaign on May 29, 1931, and Chiang
Kai-shek began his third "encirclement and suppression" campaign on July
1). The timing of the retreat is decided in the same way as the timing of
the preparatory phase of a counter-campaign which we discussed earlier, that
is, entirely on the basis of the requisite information we have collected
and of the appraisal of the general situation on the enemy side and on our
own.
<P>
It is extremely difficult to convince the cadres and the people of the necessity
of strategic retreat when they have had no experience of it, and when the
prestige of the army leadership is not yet such that it can concentrate the
authority for deciding on strategic retreat in the hands of a few persons
or of a single person and at the same time enjoy the confidence of the cadres.
Because the cadres lacked experience and had no faith in strategic retreat,
great difficulties were encountered at the beginning of our first and fourth
counter-campaigns and during the whole of the fifth. During the first
counter-campaign the cadres, under the influence of the Li Li-san line, were
in favour not of retreat but of attack until they were convinced otherwise.
In the fourth counter-campaign the cadres, under the influence of military
adventurism, objected to making preparations for retreat. In the fifth, they
at first persisted in the military adventurist view, which opposed luring
the enemy in deep, but later turned to military conservatism. Another case
is that of the adherents of the Chang Kuo-tao line, who did not admit the
impossibility of establishing our bases in the regions of the Tibetan and
the Hui peoples [<A href="#BM35">35</A>] until they ran up against a brick
wall. Experience is essential for the cadres, and failure is indeed the mother
of success. But it is also necessary to learn with an open mind from other
people's experience, and it is sheer "narrow empiricism" to insist on one's
own personal experience in all matters and, in its absence, to adhere stubbornly
to one's own opinions and reject other people's experience. Our war has suffered
in no small measure on this account.
<P>
The people's lack of faith in the need for a strategic retreat, which was
due to their inexperience, was never greater than in our first counter-campaign
in Kiangsi. At that time the local Party organizations and the masses of
the people in the counties of Kian, Hsingkuo and Yungfeng were all opposed
to the Red Army's withdrawal. But after the experience of the first
counter-campaign, no such problem occurred in the subsequent ones. Everyone
was convinced that the loss of territory in the base area and the sufferings
of the people were temporary and was confident that the Red Army could smash
the enemy's "encirclement and suppression". However, whether or not the people
have faith is closely tied up with whether or not the cadres have faith,
and hence the first and foremost task is to convince the cadres.
<P>
Strategic retreat is aimed solely at switching over to the counteroffensive
and is merely the first stage of the strategic defensive. The decisive link
in the entire strategy is whether victory can be won in the stage of the
counter-offensive which follows.
<H4>4. STRATEGIC COUNTER-OFFENSIVE</H4>
<P>
To defeat the offensive of an enemy who enjoys absolute superiority we rely
on the situation created during the stage of our strategic retreat, a situation
which is favourable to ourselves, unfavourable to the enemy and different
from that at the beginning of his offensive. It takes many elements to make
up such a situation. All this has been dealt with above.
<P>
However, the presence of these conditions and of a situation favourable to
ourselves and unfavourable to the enemy does not mean that we have already
defeated him. Such conditions and such a situation provide the possibility
for our victory and his defeat, but do not constitute the reality of victory
or defeat; they have not yet brought actual victory or defeat to either army.
To bring about victory or defeat a decisive battle between the two armies
is necessary. Only a decisive battle can settle the question as to which
army is the victor and which the vanquished. This is the sole task in the
stage of strategic counter-offensive. The counter-offensive is a long process,
the most fascinating, the most dynamic, and also the final stage of a defensive
campaign. What is called active defence refers chiefly to this strategic
counter-offensive, which is in the nature of a decisive engagement.
<P>
Conditions and situation are created not only in the stage of the strategic
retreat, but continue to be created in that of the counter-offensive. Whether
in form or in nature, they are not exactly the same in the latter stage as
in the former.
<P>
What might remain the same in form and in nature, for example, is the fact
that the enemy troops will be even more fatigued and depleted, which is simply
a continuation of their fatigue and depletion in the previous stage.
<P>
But wholly new conditions and a wholly new situation are bound to emerge.
Thus, when the enemy has suffered one or more defeats, the conditions
advantageous to us and disadvantageous to him will not be confined to his
fatigue, etc., but a new factor will have been added, namely, that he has
suffered defeats. New changes will take place in the situation, too. When
the enemy begins to manoeuvre his troops in a disorderly way and to make
false moves, the relative strengths of the two opposing armies will naturally
no longer be the same as before.
<P>
But if it is not the enemy's forces but ours that have suffered one or more
defeats, then both the conditions and the situation will change in the opposite
direction. That is to say, the enemy's disadvantages will be reduced, while
on our side disadvantages will emerge and even grow. That again will be something
entirely new and different.
<P>
A defeat for either side will lead directly and speedily to a new effort
by the defeated side to avert disaster, to extricate itself from the new
conditions and the new situation unfavourable to it and favourable to the
enemy and to re-create such conditions and such a situation as are favourable
to it and unfavourable to its opponent, in order to bring pressure to bear
on the latter.
<P>
The effort of the winning side will be exactly the opposite.<B> </B>It will
strive to exploit its victory and inflict still greater damage on<B> </B>the
enemy, add to the conditions that are in its favour and further improve its
situation, and prevent the enemy from succeeding in extricating himself from
his unfavourable conditions and unfavourable situation and averting disaster.
<P>
Thus, for either side, the struggle at the stage of the decisive battle is
the most intense, the most complicated and the most changeful as well as
the most difficult and trying in the whole war or the whole campaign; it
is the most exacting time of all from the point of view of command.
<P>
In the stage of counter-offensive, there are many problems, the chief of
which are the starting of the counter-offensive, the concentration of troops,
mobile warfare, war of quick decision and war of annihilation.
<P>
Whether in a counter-offensive or in an offensive, the principles with regard
to these problems do not differ in their basic character. In this sense we
may say that a counter-offensive is an offensive.
<P>
Still, it is not exactly an offensive. The principles of the counter-offensive
are applied when the enemy is on the offensive. The principles of the offensive
are applied when the enemy is on the defensive. In this sense, there are
certain differences between a counter-offensive and an offensive.
<P>
For this reason, although the various operational problems are all included
in the discussion of the counter-offensive in the present chapter on the
strategic defensive, and although the chapter on the strategic offensive
will deal only with other problems in order to avoid repetition, we should
not overlook either the similarities or the differences between the
counter-offensive and the offensive when it comes to actual application.
<H4> 5. STARTING THE COUNTER-OFFENSIVE</H4>
<P>
The problem of starting a counter-offensive is the problem of the "initial
battle" or "prelude".
<P>
Many bourgeois military experts advise caution in the initial battle, whether
one is on<B> </B>the strategic defensive or on the strategic offensive, but
more especially when on the defensive. In the past we, too, have stressed
this as a serious point. Our operations against the five enemy campaigns
of "encirclement and suppression" in Kiangsi Province have given us rich
experience, a study of which will not be without benefit.
<P>
In his first campaign, the enemy employed about 100,000 men, divided Into
eight columns, to advance southward from the Kian-Chienning line against
the Red Army's base area. The Red Army had about 40,000 men and was concentrated
in the area of Huangpi and Hsiaopu in Ningtu County, Kiangsi Province.
<P>
The situation was as follows:
<P>
(1) The "suppression" forces did not exceed 100,000 men, none of whom were
Chiang Kai-shek's own troops, and the general situation was not very grave.
<P>
(2) The enemy division under Lo Lin, defending Kian, was located across the
Kan River to the west.
<P>
(3) The three enemy divisions under Kung Ping-fan, Chang Hui-tsan and Tan
Tao-yuan had advanced and occupied the Futien-Tungku-Lungkang-Yuantou sector
southeast of Kian and northwest of Ningtu. The main body of Chang Hui-tsan's
division was at Lungkang and that of Tan Tao-yuan's division at Yuantou.
It was not advisable to select Futien and Tungku as the battleground, as
the inhabitants, misled by the A-B Group, were for a time mistrustful of
and opposed to the Red Army.
<P>
(4) The enemy division under Liu Ho-ting was far away in Chienning in the
White area of Fukien, and was unlikely to cross into Kiangsi.
<P>
(5) The two enemy divisions under Mao Ping-wen and Hsu Keh-hsiang had entered
the Toupi-Lokou-Tungshao sector lying between Kuangchang and Ningtu. Toupi<B>
</B>was a White area, Lokou a guerrilla zone, and Tungshao, where there were
A-B Group elements, was a place from which information was liable to leak
out. Furthermore, if we were to attack Mao Ping-wen and Hsu Keh-hsiang and
then drive westward, the three enemy divisions m the west under Chang Hui-tsan,
Tan Tao-yuan and Kung Ping-fan might join forces, thus making it difficult
for us to win victory and impossible to bring the issue to a final solution.
<P>
(6) The two divisions under Chang Hui-tsan and Tan Tao-yuan, which made up
the enemy's main force,<B> </B>were troops belonging to Lu Ti-ping, who was
commander-in-chief of this "encirclement and suppression" campaign and governor
of Kiangsi Province, and Chang Hui-tsan was the field commander. To wipe
out these two divisions would be practically to smash the campaign. Each
division had about fourteen thousand men and Chang's was divided between
two places, so that if we attacked one division at a time we would enjoy
absolute superiority.
<P>
(7) The Lungkang-Yuantou sector, where the main forces of the Chang and Tan
divisions were located, was close to our concentrations, and there was good
popular support to cover our approach.
<P>
(8) The terrain in Lungkang was good. Yuantou was not easy to attack. But
were the enemy to advance to Hsiaopu to attack us, we would have good terrain
there too.
<P>
(9) We could mass the largest number of troops in the Lungkang sector. In
Hsingkuo, less than a hundred <em>li</em> to the southwest of Lungkang, we
had an independent division of over one thousand men, which could manoeuvre
in the enemy's rear.
<P>
(10) If our troops made a breakthrough at the centre and breached the enemy's
front, his columns to the east and west would be cut into two widely separated
groups.
<P>
For the above reasons, we decided that our first battle should be against
Chang Hui-tsan's main force, and we successfully hit two of his brigades
and his divisional headquarters, capturing the entire force of nine thousand
men and the divisional commander himself, without letting a single man or
horse escape. This one victory scared Tan's division into fleeing towards
Tungshao and Hsu's division into fleeing towards Toupi. Our troops then pursued
Tan's division and wiped out half of it. We fought two battles in five days
(December 27, 1930 to January 1, 1931), and, fearing defeat, the enemy forces
in Futien, Tungku and Toupi retreated in disorder. So ended the first campaign
of "encirclement and suppression".
<P>
The situation in the second campaign was as follows:
<P>
(1) The "suppression" forces numbering 200,000 were under the command of
Ho Ying-chin with headquarters at Nanchang.
<P>
(2) As in the first enemy campaign, none of the forces were Chiang Kai-shek's
own troops. Among them the 18th Route Army under Tsai Ting-kai, the 26th
under Sun Lien-chung and the 8th under Chu Shao-liang were strong, or fairly
strong, while all the rest were rather weak.
<P>
(3) The A-B Group had been cleaned up, and the entire population of the base
area supported the Red Army.
<P>
(4) The 5th Route Army under Wang Chin-yu, newly arrived from the north,
was afraid of us, and, generally speaking, so were the two divisions on its
left flank under Kuo Hua-tsung and Hao Meng-ling.
<P>
(5) If our troops attacked Futien first and then swept across to the east,
we could expand the base area to the Chienning-Lichuan-Taining sector on
the Pukien-Kiangsi border and acquire supplies to help smash the next
"encirclement and suppression" campaign. But if we were to thrust westward,
we would come up against the Kan River and have no room for expansion after
the battle. To turn east again after the battle would tire our troops and
waste time.
<P>
(6) Though our army (numbering over 30,000 men) was somewhat smaller than
in the first campaign, it had had four months in which to recuperate and
build up energy.
<P>
For these reasons, we decided, for our first battle, to engage the forces
of Wang Chin-yu and of Kung Ping-fan (totalling 11 regiments) in the Futien
sector. After winning this battle we attacked Kuo Huatsung, Sun Lien-chung,
Chu Shao-liang and Liu Ho-ting in succession. In fifteen days (from May 16
to May 30, 1931) we marched seven hundred li, fought five battles, captured
more than twenty thousand rifles and roundly smashed the enemy's "encirclement
and suppression" campaign. When fighting Wang Chin-yu, we were between the
two enemy forces under Tsai Ting-kai and Kuo Hua-tsung, some ten li from
the latter and forty li from the former, and some people said we were "getting
into a blind alley", but we got through all the same. This was mainly due
to the popular support we enjoyed in the base area and to the lack of
co-ordination among the enemy units. After Kuo Hua-tsung's division was defeated,
Hao Meng-ling's division fled by night back to Yungfeng, and so avoided disaster.
<P>
The situation in the third "encirclement and suppression" campaign was as
follows:
<P>
(1) Chiang Kai-shek personally took the held as commander-in-chief. Under
him there were three subordinate commanders, each in charge of a column--the
left, the right and the centre. The central column was commanded by Ho Ying-chin,
who, like Chiang Kai-shek, had his headquarters in Nanchang, the right was
commanded by Chen Ming-shu with headquarters at Kian, and the left by Chu
Shao-liang with headquarters at Nanfeng.
<P>
(2) The "suppression" forces numbered 300,000. The main forces, totalling
about 100,000 men, were Chiang Kai-shek's own troops and consisted of 5 divisions
(of 9 regiments each), commanded by Chen Cheng, Lo Cho-ying, Chao Kuan-tao,
Wei Lihuang and Chiang Ting-wen respectively. Besides these, there were 3
divisions (totalling 40,000 men) under Chiang Kuang-nai, Tsai Ting-kai and
Han Teh-chin. Then there was Sun Lien-chung's army of 20,000. In addition,
there were other, weaker forces that were likewise not Chiang's own troops.
<P>
(3) The enemy's strategy in this "suppression" campaign was to "drive straight
in", which was vastly different from the strategy of "consolidating at every
step" he used in the second campaign. The aim was to press the Red Army back
against the Kan River and annihilate it there.
<P>
(4) There was an interval of only one month between the end of the second
enemy campaign and the beginning of the third. The Red Army (then about 30,000
strong) had had neither rest nor replenishments after much hard fighting
and had just made a detour of a thousand li to concentrate at Hsingkuo in
the western part of the southern Kiangsi base area, when the enemy pressed
it hard from several directions.
<P>
In this situation the plan we first decided on was to move from Hsingkuo
by way of Wanan, make a breakthrough at Futien, and then sweep from west
to east across the enemy's rear communication lines, thus letting the enemy's
main forces make a deep but useless penetration into our base area in southern
Kiangsi; this was to be the first phase of our operation. Then when the enemy
turned back northward, inevitably very fatigued, we were to seize the opportunity
to strike at his vulnerable units; that was to be the second phase of our
operation. The heart of this plan was to avoid the enemy's main forces and
strike at his weak spots. But when our forces were advancing on Futien, we
were detected by the enemy, who rushed the two divisions under Chen Cheng
and Lo Cho-ying to the scene. We had to change our plan and fall back to
Kaohsinghsu in the western part of Hsingkuo County, which, together with
its environs of less than a hundred square li, was then the only place for
our troops to concentrate in. The day after our concentration we decided
to make a thrust eastward towards Lientang in eastern Hsingkuo County, Liangtsun
in southern Yungfeng County and Huangpi in northern Ningtu County. That same
night, under covet of darkness, we passed through the forty-li gap between
Chiang Ting-wen's division and the forces of Chiang Kuang-nai, Tsai Ting-kai
and Han Teh-chin, and swung to Lientang. On the second day we skirmished
with the forward units under Shangkuan Yun-hsiang (who was in command of
Hao Meng-ling's division as well as his own). The first battle was fought
on the third day with Shangkuan Yun-hsiang's division and the second battle
on the fourth day with Hao Meng-ling's division; after a three day march
we reached Huangpi and fought our third battle against Mao Ping-wen's division.
We won all three battles and captured over ten thousand rifles. At this point
all the main enemy forces, which had been advancing westward and southward,
turned eastward. Focusing on Huangpi, they converged at furious speed to
seek battle and closed in on us in a major compact encirclement. We slipped
through in the high mountains that lay in the twenty-li gap between the forces
of Chiang Kuang-nai, Tsai Ting-kai and Han Teh-chin on the one side and Chen
Cheng and Lo Cho-ying on the other, and thus, returning from the east to
the west, reassembled within the borders of Hsingkuo County. By the time
the enemy discovered this fact and began advancing west again, our forces
had already had a fortnight's rest, whereas the enemy forces, hungry, exhausted
and demoralized, were no good for fighting and so decided to retreat. Taking
advantage of their retreat, we attacked the forces of Chiang Kuang-nai, Tsai
Ting-kai, Chiang Ting-wen and Han Teh-chin, wiping out one of Chiang Ting-wen's
brigades and Han Tehchin's entire division. As for the divisions under Chiang
Kuang-nai and Tsai Ting-kai, the fight resulted in a stalemate and they got
away.
<P>
The situation in the fourth "encirclement and suppression" campaign was as
follows. The enemy was advancing on Kuangchang in three columns; the eastern
one was his main force, while the two divisions forming his western column
were exposed to us and were also very close to the area where our forces
were concentrated. Thus we had the opportunity to attack his western column
in southern Yihuang County first, and at one stroke we annihilated the two
divisions under Li Ming and Chen Shih-chi. As the enemy then sent two divisions
from the eastern column to give support to his central column and advanced
further, we were again able to wipe out a division in southern Yihuang County.
In these two battles we captured more than ten thousand rifles and, in the
main, smashed this campaign of "encirclement and suppression".
<P>
In his fifth campaign the enemy advanced by means of his new strategy of
building blockhouses and first occupied Lichuan. But, in attempting to recover
Lichuan and engage the enemy outside the base area, we made an attack north
of Lichuan at Hsiaoshih, which was an enemy strong point and was situated,
moreover, in the White area. Failing to win the battle, we shifted our attack
to Tzehsichiao, which was also an enemy strongpoint situated in the White
area southeast of Hsiaoshih, and again we failed. Then in seeking battle
we milled around between the enemy's main forces and his blockhouses and
were reduced to complete passivity. All through our fifth counter-campaign
against "encirclement and suppression", which lasted a whole year, we showed
not the slightest initiative or drive. In the end we had to withdraw from
our Kiangsi base area.
<P>
Our army's experience in these five counter-campaigns against "encirclement
and suppression" proves that the first battle in the counter-offensive is
of the greatest importance for the Red Army, which is on the defensive, if
it is to smash a large and powerful enemy "suppression" force. Victory or
defeat in the first battle has a tremendous effect upon the entire situation,
all the way to the final engagement. Hence we arrive at the following
conclusions.
<P>
First, the first battle must be won. We should strike only when positively
certain that the enemy's situation, the terrain and popular support are all
in our favour and not in his. Otherwise we should rather fall back and carefully
bide our time. There will always be opportunities; we should not rashly accept
battle. In our first counter-campaign we originally planned to strike at
Tan Tao-yuan's troops; we advanced twice but each time had to restrain ourselves
and pull back, because they would not budge from their commanding position
on the Yuantou heights. A few days later we sought out Chang Huitsan's troops,
which were more vulnerable to our attack. In our second counter-campaign
our army advanced to Tungku where, for the sole purpose of waiting for Wang
Chin-yu's men to leave their strongpoint at Futien, we encamped close to
the enemy for twenty-five days even at the risk of leakage of information;
we rejected all impatient suggestions for a quick attack and finally attained
our aim. In our third counter-campaign, although the storm was breaking all
around us and we had made a detour of a thousand li, and although the enemy
had discovered our plan to outflank him, we nevertheless exercised patience,
turned back, changed our tactics to a breakthrough in the centre, and finally
fought the first battle successfully at Lientang. In our fourth counter-campaign,
after our attack on Nanfeng had failed, we unhesitatingly withdrew, wheeled
round to the enemy's right flank, and reassembled our forces in the area
of Tungshao, whereupon we launched our great and victorious battle in southern
Yihuang County. It was only in the fifth counter-campaign that the importance
of the first battle was not recognized at all. Taking alarm at the loss of
the single county town of Lichuan, our forces marched north to meet the enemy
in an attempt to recover it. Then, the unexpected encounter at Hsunkou, which
had resulted in a victory (with the annihilation of an enemy division), was
not treated as the first battle, nor were the changes that were bound to
ensue foreseen, but instead Hsiaoshih was rashly attacked with no assurance
of success. Thus the initiative was lost at the very first move, and that
is really the worst and most stupid way to fight.
<P>
Second, the plan for the first battle must be the prelude to, and an organic
part of, the plan for the whole campaign. Without a good plan for the whole
campaign it is absolutely impossible to fight a really good first battle.
That is to say, even though victory is won in<B> </B>the first battle, if
the battle harms rather than helps the campaign as a whole, such a victory
can only be reckoned a defeat (as in the case of the battle of Hsunkou in
the fifth campaign). Hence, before fighting the first battle one must have
a general idea of how the second, third, fourth, and even the final battle
will be fought, and consider what changes will ensue in the enemy's situation
as a whole if we win, or lose, each of the succeeding battles. Although the
result may not--and, in fact, definitely will not--turn out exactly as we
expect, we must think everything out carefully and realistically in the light
of the general situation on both sides. Without a grasp of the situation
as a whole, it is impossible to make any really good move on the chessboard.
<P>
Third, one must also consider what will happen in the next strategic stage
of the war. Whoever directs strategy will not be doing his duty if he occupies
himself only with the counter-offensive and neglects the measures to be taken
after it succeeds, or in case it fails. In a particular strategic stage,
he should take into consideration the succeeding stages, or, at the very
least, the following one. Even though future changes are difficult to foresee
and the farther ahead one looks the more blurred things seem, a general
calculation is possible and an appraisal of distant prospects is necessary.
In war as well as in politics, planning only one step at a time as one goes
along is a harmful way of directing matters. After each step, it is necessary
to examine the ensuing concrete changes and to modify or develop one's strategic
and operational plans accordingly, or otherwise one is liable to make the
mistake of rushing straight ahead regardless of danger. However, it is absolutely
essential to have a long-term plan which has been thought out in its general
outline and which covers an entire strategic stage or even several strategic
stages. Failure to make such a plan will lead to the mistake of hesitating
and allowing oneself to be tied down, which in fact serves the enemy's strategic
objects and reduces one to a passive position. It must be borne in mind that
the enemy's supreme command is not lacking in strategic insight. Only when
we have trained ourselves to be a head taller than the enemy will strategic
victories be possible. During the enemy's fifth "encirclement and suppression"
campaign, failure to do so was the main reason for the errors in strategic
direction under the "Left" opportunist and the Chang Kuo-tao lines. In short,
in the stage of retreat we must see ahead to the stage of the counter-offensive,
in the stage of the counter-offensive we must see ahead to that of the offensive,
and in the stage of the offensive we must again see ahead to a stage of retreat.
Not to do so but to confine ourselves to considerations of the moment is
to court defeat.
<P>
The first battle must be won. The plan for the whole campaign must be taken
into account. And the strategic stage that comes next must be taken into
account. These are the three principles we must never forget when we begin
a counter-offensive, that is, when we fight the first battle.
<H4>6. CONCENTRATION OF TROOPS</H4>
<P>
The concentration of troops seems easy but is quite hard in practice. Everybody
knows that the best way is to use a large force to defeat a small one, and
yet many people fail to do so and on the contrary often divide their forces
up. The reason is that such military leaders have no head for strategy and
are confused by complicated circumstances; hence, they are at the mercy of
these circumstances, lose their initiative and have recourse to passive response.
<P>
No matter how complicated, grave and harsh the circumstances, what a military
leader needs most of all is the ability to function independently in organizing
and employing the forces under his command. He may often be forced into a
passive position by the enemy, but the important thing is to regain the
initiative quickly. Failure to do so spells defeat.
<P>
The initiative is not something imaginary but is concrete and material. Here
the most important thing is to conserve and mass an armed force that is as
large as possible and full of fighting spirit.
<P>
It is easy to fall into a passive position in defensive warfare, which gives
far less scope for the full exercise of initiative than does offensive warfare.
However, defensive warfare, which is passive in form, can be active in content,
and can be switched from the stage in which it is passive in form to the
stage in which it is active both in form and in content. In appearance a
fully planned strategic retreat is made under compulsion, but in reality
it is effected in order to conserve our strength and bide our time to defeat
the enemy, to lure him in deep and prepare for our counter-offensive. On
the other hand, refusal to retreat and hasty acceptance of battle (as in
the battle of Hsiaoshih) may appear a serious effort to gain the initiative,
while in reality it is passive. Not only is a strategic counter-offensive
active in content, but in form, too, it discards the passive posture of the
period of retreat. In relation to the enemy, our counter-offensive represents
our effort to make him relinquish the initiative and put him in a passive
position.
<P>
Concentration of troops, mobile warfare, war of quick decision and war of
annihilation are all necessary conditions for the full achievement of this
aim. And of these, concentration of troops is the first and most essential.
<P>
This concentration is necessary for the purpose of reversing the situation
as between the enemy and ourselves. First, its purpose is to reverse the
situation as regards advance and retreat. Previously it was the enemy who
was advancing and we who were retreating; now we seek a situation in which
we advance and he retreats. When we concentrate our troops and win a battle,
then in that battle we gain the above purpose, and this influences the whole
campaign.
<P>
Second, its purpose is to reverse the situation with regard to attack and
defence. In defensive warfare the retreat to the prescribed terminal point
belongs basically to the passive, or "defence", stage. The counter-offensive
belongs to the active, or "attack", stage. Although the strategic defensive
retains its defensive character throughout its duration, still as compared
with the retreat the counter-offensive already represents a change not only
in form but in content. The counter-offensive is transitional between the
strategic defensive and the strategic offensive, and in the nature of a prelude
to the strategic offensive; it is precisely for the purpose of the
counter-offensive that troops are concentrated.
<P>
Third, its purpose is to reverse the situation with regard to interior and
exterior lines. An army operating on strategically interior lines suffers
from many disadvantages, and this is especially so in the case of the Red
Army, confronted as it is with "encirclement and suppression". But in campaigns
and battles we can and absolutely must change this situation. We can turn
a big "encirclement and suppression" campaign waged by the enemy against
us into a number of small, separate campaigns of encirclement and suppression
waged by us against the enemy. We can change the converging attack directed
by the enemy against us on the plane of strategy into converging attacks
directed by us against the enemy on the plane of campaigns and battles. We
can change the enemy's strategic superiority over us into our superiority
over him in campaigns and battles. We can put the enemy who is in a strong
position strategically into a weak position in campaigns and battles. At
the same time we can change our own strategically weak position into a strong
position in campaigns and battles. This is what we call exterior-line operations
within interior-line operations, encirclement and suppression within
"encirclement and suppression", blockade within blockade, the offensive within
the defensive, superiority within inferiority, strength within weakness,
advantage within disadvantage, and initiative within passivity. The winning
of victory in the strategic defensive depends basically on this
measure--concentration of troops.
<P>
In the war annals of the Chinese Red Army, this has often been an important
controversial issue. In the battle of Kian on October 4, 1930, our advance
and attack were begun before our forces were fully concentrated, but fortunately
the enemy force (Teng Ying's division) fled of its own accord; by itself
our attack was ineffective.
<P>
Beginning from 1932, there was the slogan "Attack on all fronts", which called
for attacks from the base area in all directions--north, south, east and
west. This is wrong not only for the strategic defensive but even for the
strategic offensive. As long as there is no fundamental change in the over-all
balance of forces, both strategy and tactics involve the defensive and the
offensive, containing actions and assaults, and "attacks on all fronts" are
in fact extremely rare. This slogan expresses the military equalitarianism
which accompanies military adventurism.
<P>
In 1933 the exponents of military equalitarianism put forward the theory
of "striking with two 'fists'" and splitting the main force of the Red Army
in two, to seek victories simultaneously in two strategic directions. As
a result, one fist remained idle while the other was tired out with fighting,
and we failed to win the greatest victory possible at the time. In my opinion,
when we face a powerful enemy, we should employ our army, whatever its size,
in only one main direction at a time, not two. I am not objecting to operations
in two or more directions, but at any given time there ought to be only one
main direction. The Chinese Red Army, which entered the arena of the civil
war as a small and weak force, has since repeatedly defeated its powerful
antagonist and won victories that have astonished the world, and it has done
so by relying largely on the employment of concentrated strength. Any one
of its great victories can prove this point. When we say, "Pit one against
ten, pit ten against a hundred", we are speaking of strategy, of the whole
war and the over-all balance of forces, and in the strategic sense that is
just what we have been doing. However, we are not speaking of campaigns and
tactics, in which we must never do so. Whether in counter-offensives or
offensives, we should always concentrate a big force to strike at one part
of the enemy forces. We suffered every time we did not concentrate our troops,
as in the battles against Tan Tao-yuan in the Tungshao area of Ningtu County
in Kiangsi Province in January 1931, against the 19th Route Army in the
Kaohsinghsu area of Hsingkuo County in Kiangsi in August 1931, against Chen
Chi-tang in the Shuikouhsu area of Nanhsiung County in Kwangtung Province
in July 1932, and against Chen Cheng in the Tuantsun area of Lichuan County
in Kiangsi in March 1934. In the past, battles such as those of Shuikouhsu
and Tuantsun were generally deemed victories or even big victories (in the
former we routed twenty regiments under Chen Chi-tang, in the latter twelve
regiments under Chen Cheng), but we never welcomed such victories and in
a certain sense even regarded them as defeats. For, in our opinion, a battle
has little significance when there are no prisoners or war booty, or when
they do not outweigh the losses.
<P>
Our strategy is "pit one against ten" and our tactics are "pit ten against
one"--this is one of our fundamental principles for gaining mastery over
the enemy.
<P>
Military equalitarianism reached its extreme point in our fifth counter-campaign
against "encirclement and suppression" in 1934. It was thought that we could
beat the enemy by "dividing the forces into six routes" and "resisting on
all fronts", but instead we were beaten by the enemy, and the reason was
fear of losing territory. Naturally one can scarcely avoid loss of territory
when concentrating the main forces in one direction while leaving only containing
forces in others. But this loss is temporary and partial and is compensated
for by victory in the place where the assault is made. After such a victory
is won, territory lost in the area of the containing forces can be recovered.
The enemy's first, second, third and fourth campaigns of "encirclement and
suppression" all entailed the loss of territory-- particularly the third
campaign, in which the Kiangsi base area of the Red Army was almost completely
lost--but in the end we not only recovered but extended our territory.
<P>
Failure to appreciate the strength of the people in the base area has often
given rise to unwarranted fear of moving the Red Army too far away from the
base area. This happened when the Red Army in Kiangsi made a long drive to
attack Changchow in Fukien Province in 1932, and also when it wheeled around
to attack Fukien after the victory in our fourth counter-campaign in 1933.
There was fear in the first case that the enemy would seize the entire base
area, and in the second that he would seize part of it; consequently there
was opposition to concentrating our forces and advocacy of dividing them
up for defence, but in the end all this proved to be wrong. As far as the
enemy is concerned, he is afraid to advance into our base area, but the main
danger in his eyes is a Red Army that has driven into the White area. His
attention is always fixed on the whereabouts of the main force of the Red
Army, and he rarely takes his eyes off it to concentrate on the base area.
Even when the Red Army is on the defensive, it is still the centre of the
enemy's attention. Part of his over-all plan is to reduce the size of our
base area, but if the Red Army concentrates its main force to annihilate
one of his columns, the enemy's supreme command will be compelled to focus
greater attention on the Red Army and concentrate larger forces against it.
Hence it is possible to wreck an enemy plan for reducing the size of a base
area.
<P>
Also, it was wrong to say, "In the fifth 'encirclement and suppression' campaign
which is being carried on by means of blockhouse warfare, it is impossible
for us to operate with concentrated forces, and all we can do is to divide
them up for defence and for short swift thrusts." The enemy's tactics of
pushing forward 3, 5, 8, or 10 li at a time and building blockhouses at each
halt were entirely the result of the Red Army's practice of fighting defensive
actions at every successive point. The situation would certainly have been
different if our army had abandoned the tactics of point-by-point defence
on interior lines and, when possible and necessary, had turned and driven
into the enemy's interior lines. The principle of concentration of forces
is precisely the means for defeating the enemy's blockhouse warfare.
<P>
The kind of concentration of forces we advocate does not mean the abandonment
of people's guerrilla warfare. To abandon small-scale guerrilla warfare and
"concentrate every single rifle in the Red Army", as advocated by the Li
Li-san line, has long since been proved wrong. Considering the revolutionary
war as a whole, the operations of the people's guerrillas and those of the
main forces of the Red Army complement each other like a man's right arm
and left arm, and if we had only the main forces of the Red Army without
the people's guerrillas, we would be like a warrior with only one arm. In
concrete terms, and especially with regard to military operations, when we
talk of the people in the base area as a factor, we mean that we have an
armed people. That is the main reason why the enemy is afraid to approach
our base area.
<P>
It is also necessary to employ Red Army detachments for operations in secondary
directions; not all the forces of the Red Army should be concentrated. The
kind of concentration we advocate is based on the principle of guaranteeing
absolute or relative superiority on the battlefield. To cope with a strong
enemy or to fight on a battlefield of vital importance, we must have an
absolutely superior force; for instance, a force of 40,000 was concentrated
to fight the 9,000 men under Chang Hui-tsan on December 30, 1930, in the
first battle of our first counter-campaign. To cope with a weaker enemy or
to fight on a battlefield of no great importance, a relatively superior force
is sufficient; for instance, only some 10,000 Red Army men were employed
to fight Liu Ho-ting's division of 7,000 men in Chienning on May 29, 1931,
in the last battle of our second counter-campaign.
<P>
That is not to say we must have numerical superiority on every occasion.
In certain circumstances, we may go into battle with a relatively or absolutely
inferior force. Take the case of going into battle with a relatively inferior
force when we have only a rather small Red Army force in a certain area (it
is not that we have more troops and have not concentrated them). Then, in
order to smash the attack of the stronger enemy in conditions where popular
support, terrain and weather are greatly in our favour, it is of course necessary
to concentrate the main part of our Red Army force for a surprise attack
on a segment of one flank of the enemy while containing his centre and his
other flank with guerrillas or small detachments, and in this way victory
can be won. In our surprise attack on this segment of the enemy flank, the
principle of using a superior force against an inferior force, of using the
many to defeat the few, still applies. The same principle also applies when
we go into battle with an absolutely inferior force, for example, when a
guerrilla force makes a surprise attack on a large White army force, but
is attacking only a small part of it.
<P>
As for the argument that the concentration of a large force for action in
a single battle area is subject to the limitations of terrain, roads, supplies
and billeting facilities, it should be evaluated according to the circumstances.
There is a difference in the degree to which these limitations affect the
Red Army and the White army, as the Red Army can stand greater hardships
than the White army.
<P>
We use the few to defeat the many--this we say to the rulers of China as
a whole. We use the many to defeat the few--this we say to each separate
enemy force on the battlefield. That is no longer a secret, and in general
the enemy is by now well acquainted with our way. However, he can neither
prevent our victories nor avoid his own losses, because he does not know
when and where we shall act. This we keep secret. The Red Army generally
operates by surprise attacks.
<H4>7. MOBILE WARFARE</H4>
<P>
Mobile warfare or positional warfare? Our answer is mobile warfare. So long
as we lack a large army or reserves of ammunition, and so long as there is
only a single Red Army force to do the fighting in each base area, positional
warfare is generally useless to us. For us, positional warfare is generally
inapplicable in attack as well as in defence.
<P>
One of the outstanding characteristics of the Red Army's operations, which
follows from the fact that the enemy is powerful while the Red Army is deficient
in technical equipment, is the absence of fixed battle lines.
<P>
The Red Army's battle lines are determined by the direction in which it is
operating. As its operational direction often shifts, its battle lines are
fluid. Though the main direction does not change in a given period of time,
within its ambit the secondary directions may shift at any moment; when we
find ourselves checked in one direction, we must turn to another. If, after
a time, we also find ourselves checked in the main direction, then we must
change it too.
<P>
In a revolutionary civil war, there cannot be fixed battle lines, which was
also the case in the Soviet Union. The difference between the Soviet Army
and ours is that its battle lines were not so fluid as ours. There cannot
be absolutely fixed battle lines in any war, because the vicissitudes of
victory and defeat, advance and retreat, preclude it. But relatively fixed
battle lines are often to be found in the general run of wars. Exceptions
occur only where an army faces a much stronger enemy, as is the case with
the Chinese Red Army in its present stage.
<P>
Fluidity of battle lines leads to fluidity in the size of our base areas.
Our base areas are constantly expanding and contracting, and often as one
base area falls another rises. This fluidity of territory is entirely a result
of the fluidity of the war.
<P>
Fluidity in the war and in our territory produces fluidity in all fields
of construction in our base areas. Construction plans covering several years
are out of the question. Frequent changes of plan are all in the day's work.
<P>
It is to our advantage to recognize this characteristic. We must base our
planning on it and must not have illusions about a war of advance without
any retreats, take alarm at any temporary fluidity of our territory or of
the rear areas of our army, or endeavour to draw up detailed long-term plans.
We must adapt our thinking and our work to the circumstances, be ready to
sit down as well as to march on, and always have our marching rations handy.
It is only by exerting ourselves in today's fluid way of life that tomorrow
we can secure relative stability, and eventually full stability.
<P>
The exponents of the strategy of "regular warfare" which dominated our fifth
counter-campaign denied this fluidity and opposed| what they called
"guerrilla-ism". Those comrades who opposed fluidity managed affairs as though
they were the rulers of a big state, and the result was an extraordinary
and immense fluidity-- the 25,000<em>-li </em>Long March.
<P>
Our workers' and peasants' democratic republic is a state, but today it is
not yet a full-fledged one. Today we are still in the period of strategic
defensive in the civil war, the form of our political power is still far
from that of a full-fledged state, our army is still much inferior to the
enemy both in numbers and technical equipment, our territory is still very
small, and our enemy is constantly out to destroy us and will never rest
content till he has done so. In defining our policy on the basis of these
facts, we should not repudiate guerrilla-ism in general terms but should
honestly admit the guerrilla character of the Red Army. It is no use being
ashamed of this. On the contrary, this guerrilla character is precisely our
distinguishing feature, our strong point, and our means of defeating the
enemy. We should be prepared to discard it, but we cannot do so today. In
the future this guerrilla character will definitely become something to be
ashamed of and to be discarded, but today it is invaluable and we must stick
to it.
<P>
"Fight when you can win, move away when you can't win"--this is the popular
way of describing our mobile warfare today. There is no military expert anywhere
in the world who approves only of fighting and never of moving, though few
people do as much moving as we do. We generally spend more time in moving
than in fighting and would be doing well if we fought an average of one sizable
battle a month. All our "moving" is for the purpose of "fighting", and all
our strategy and tactics are built on "fighting". Nevertheless, there are
times when it is inadvisable for us to fight. In the first place, it is
inadvisable to fight when the force confronting us is too large; second,
it is sometimes inadvisable to fight when the force confronting us, though
not so large, is very dose to other enemy forces; third, it is generally
inadvisable to fight an enemy force that is not isolated and is strongly
entrenched; fourth, it is inadvisable to continue an engagement in which
there is no prospect of victory. In any one of these situations we are prepared
to move away. Such moving away is both permissible and necessary. For our
recognition of the necessity of moving away is based on our recognition of
the necessity of fighting. Herein lies the fundamental characteristic of
the Red Army's mobile warfare.
<P>
Mobile warfare is primary, but we do not reject positional warfare where
it is possible and necessary. It should be admitted that positional warfare
should be employed for the tenacious defence of particular key points in
a containing action during the strategic defensive, and when, during the
strategic offensive, we encounter an enemy force that is isolated and cut
off from help. We have had considerable experience in defeating the enemy
by such positional warfare; we have cracked open many enemy cities, blockhouses
and forts and broken through fairly well-fortified enemy field positions.
In future we shall increase our efforts and remedy our inadequacies in this
respect. We should by all means advocate positional attack or defence when
circumstances require and permit it. At the present time, what we are opposed
to is the general use of positional warfare or putting it on an equal footing
with mobile` warfare; that is impermissible.
<P>
During the ten years' civil war, have there been no changes whatsoever in
the guerrilla character of the Red Army, its lack of fixed battle lines,
the fluidity of its base areas, or the fluidity of construction work in its
base areas? Yes, there have been changes. The period from the days in the
Chingkang Mountains to our first counter-campaign against "encirclement and
suppression" in Kiangsi was the first stage, the stage in which the guerrilla
character and fluidity were very pronounced, the Red Army being in its infancy
and the base areas still being guerrilla zones. In the second stage, comprising
the period from the first to the third counter-campaign, both the guerrilla
character and the fluidity were considerably reduced, front armies having
been formed and base areas with a population of several millions established.
In the third stage, which comprised the period from the end of the third
to the fifth counter-campaign, the guerrilla character and the fluidity were
further reduced, and a central government and a revolutionary military commission
had already been set up. The fourth stage was the Long March. The mistaken
rejection of guerrilla warfare and fluidity on a small scale had led to guerrilla
warfare and fluidity on a great scale. Now we are in the fifth stage. Because
of our failure to smash the fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign
and because of this great fluidity, the Red Army and the base areas have
been greatly reduced, but we have planted our feet in the Northwest and
consolidated and developed the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region, our base
area here. The three front armies which form the main forces of the Red Army
have been brought under a unified command, which is unprecedented.
<P>
Going by the nature of our strategy, we may also say the period from the
days in the Chingkang Mountains to our fourth counter-campaign was one stage,
the period of the fifth counter-campaign was another, and the period from
the Long March to the present is the third. During the fifth counter-campaign
the correct policy of the past was wrongly discarded; today we have correctly
discarded the wrong policy adopted during the fifth counter-campaign and
revived the earlier and correct policy. However, we have not thrown out
everything in the fifth counter-campaign, nor revived everything that preceded
it. We have revived only what was good in the past, and discarded only the
mistakes of the period of the fifth counter-campaign.
<P>
Guerrilla-ism has two aspects. One is irregularity, that is, decentralization,
lack of uniformity, absence of strict discipline, and simple methods of work.
These features stemmed from the Red Army's infancy, and some of them were
just what was needed at the time. As the Red Army reaches a higher stage,
we must gradually and consciously eliminate them so as to make the Red Army
more centralized, more unified, more disciplined and more thorough in its
work--in short, more regular in character. In the directing of operations
we should also gradually and consciously reduce such guerrilla characteristics
as are no longer required at a higher stage. Refusal to make progress in
this respect and obstinate adherence to the old stage are impermissible and
harmful, and are detrimental to large-scale operations.
<P>
The other aspect of guerrilla-ism consists of the principle of mobile warfare,
the guerrilla character of both strategic and tactical operations which is
still necessary at present, the inevitable fluidity of our base areas,
flexibility in planning the development of the base areas, and the rejection
of premature regularization in building the Red Army. In this connection,
it is equally impermissible, disadvantageous and harmful to our present
operations to deny the facts of history, oppose the retention of what is
useful, and rashly leave the present stage in order to rush blindly towards
a "new stage", which as yet is beyond reach and has no real significance.
<P>
We are now on the eve of a new stage with respect<B> </B>to the Red Army's
technical equipment and organization. We must be prepared to go over to this
new stage. Not to prepare ourselves would be wrong and harmful to our future
warfare. In the future, when the technical and organizational conditions
in the Red Army have changed and the building of the Red Army has entered
a new stage, its operational directions and battle lines will become more
stable; there will be more positional warfare; the fluidity of the war, of
our territory and of our construction work will be greatly reduced and finally
disappear; and we will no longer be handicapped by present limitations, such
as the enemy's superiority and his strongly entrenched positions.
<P>
At present we oppose both the wrong measures of the period of the domination
of "Left" opportunism and the revival of many of the irregular features which
the Red Army had in its infancy but which are now unnecessary. But we should
be resolute in restoring the many valuable principles of army building and
of strategy and tactics by which the Red Army has consistently won its victories.
We must sum up all that is good from the past in a systematic, more highly
developed and richer military line, in order to win victories over the enemy
today and prepare to go over to the new stage in the future.
<P>
The waging of mobile warfare involves many problems, such as reconnaissance,
judgement, decision, combat disposition, command, concealment, concentration,
advance, deployment, attack, pursuit, surprise attack, positional attack,
positional defence, encounter action, retreat, night fighting, special
operations, evading the strong and attacking the weak, besieging the enemy
in order to strike at his reinforcements, feint attack, defence against aircraft,
operating amongst several enemy forces, by-passing operations, consecutive
operations, operating without a rear, the need for rest and building up energy.
These problems exhibited many specific features in the history of the Red
Army, features which should be methodically dealt with and summed up in the
science of campaigns, and I shall not go<B> </B>into them here.
<H4> 8. WAR OF QUICK DECISION</H4>
<P>
A strategically protracted war and campaigns or battles of quick decision
are two aspects of the same thing, two principles which should receive equal
and simultaneous emphasis in civil wars and which are also applicable in
anti-imperialist wars.
<P>
Because the reactionary forces are very strong, revolutionary forces grow
only gradually, and this fact determines the protracted nature of our war.
Here impatience is harmful and advocacy of "quick decision" incorrect. To
wage a revolutionary war for ten years, as we have done, might be surprising
in other countries, but for us it is like the opening sections in an
"eight-legged essay"-- the "presentation, amplification and preliminary
exposition of the theme" [<A href="#BM36">36</A>] -- and many exciting parts
are yet to follow. No doubt developments in the future will be greatly
accelerated under the influence of domestic and international conditions.
As changes have already taken place in the international and domestic situation
and greater changes are coming, it can be said that we have outgrown the
past state of slow development and fighting in isolation. But we should not
expect successes overnight. The aspiration to "wipe out the enemy before
breakfast" is admirable, but it is bad to make concrete plans to do so. As
China's reactionary forces are backed by many imperialist powers, our
revolutionary war will continue to be a protracted one until China's
revolutionary forces have built up enough strength to breach the main positions
of our internal and external enemies, and until the international revolutionary
forces have crushed or contained most of the international reactionary forces.
To proceed from this point in formulating our strategy of long-term warfare
is one of the important principles guiding our strategy.
<P>
The reverse is true of campaigns and battles--here the principle is not
protractedness but quick decision. Quick decision is sought in campaigns
and battles, and this is true at all times and in all countries. In a war
as a whole, too, quick decision is sought at all times and in all countries,
and a long drawn-out war is considered harmful. China's war, however, must
be handled with the greatest patience and treated as a protracted war. During
the period of the Li Li-san line, some people ridiculed our way of doing
things as "shadowboxing tactics" (meaning our tactics of fighting many battles
back and forth before going on to seize the big cities), and said that we
would not see the victory of the revolution until our hair turned white.
Such impatience was proved wrong long ago. But if their criticism had been
applied not to strategy but to campaigns and battles, they would have been
perfectly right, and for the following reasons. First, the Red Army has no
sources from which to replenish its arms and especially its ammunition; second,
the White forces consist of many armies while there is only one Red Army,
which must be prepared to fight one operation after another in quick succession
in order to smash each campaign of "encirclement and suppression"; and third,
though the White armies advance separately, most of them keep fairly close
to one another, and if we fail to gain a quick decision in attacking one
of them, all the others will converge upon us. For these reasons we have
to fight battles of quick decision. It is usual for us to conclude a battle
in a few hours, or in a day or two. It is only when our plan is to "besiege
the enemy in order to strike at his reinforcements" and our purpose is to
strike not at the besieged enemy but at his reinforcements that we are prepared
for a certain degree of protractedness in our besieging operations; but even
then we seek a quick decision against the reinforcements. A plan of protracted
operations is often applied in campaigns or battles when we are strategically
on the defensive and are tenaciously defending positions on a holding front,
or when, in a strategic offensive, we are attacking isolated enemy forces
cut off from help, or are eliminating White strongholds within our base areas.
But protracted operations of this kind help rather than hinder the main Red
Army force in its battles of quick decision.
<P>
A quick decision cannot be achieved simply by wanting it, but requires many
specific conditions. The main requirements are: adequate preparations, seizing
the opportune moment, concentration of superior forces, encircling and
outflanking tactics, favourable terrain, and striking at the enemy when he
is on the move, or when he is stationary but has not yet consolidated his
positions. Unless these requirements are satisfied, it is impossible to achieve
quick decision in a campaign or battle.
<P>
The smashing of an enemy "encirclement and suppression" is a major campaign,
but the principle of quick decision and not that of protractedness still
applies. For the manpower, financial resources and military strength of a
base area do not allow protractedness.
<P>
While quick-decision is the general principle, we must oppose undue impatience.
It is altogether necessary that the highest military and political leading
body of a revolutionary base area, having taken into account the circumstances
in its base area and the situation of the enemy, should not be overawed by
his truculence, dispirited by hardships that can be endured, or dejected
by setbacks, but should have the requisite patience and stamina. The smashing
of the first enemy "encirclement and suppression" campaign in Kiangsi Province
| took only one week from the first battle to the last; the second was smashed
in barely a fortnight; the third dragged on for three months; before it was
smashed; the fourth took three weeks; and the fifth taxed our endurance for
a whole year. When we were compelled to break through the enemy's encirclement
after the failure to smash his fifth campaign, we showed an unjustifiable
haste. In the circumstances then obtaining, we could well have held out for
another two or three months, giving the troops some time for rest and
reorganization. If that had been done, and if the leadership had been a little
wiser after our breakthrough, the outcome would have been very different.
<P>
For all that, the principle of shortening the duration of a campaign by every
possible means remains valid. Campaign and battle plans should call for our
maximum effort in concentration of troops, mobile warfare, and so on, so
as to ensure the destruction of the enemy's effective strength on the interior
lines (that is, in the base area) and the quick defeat of his "encirclement
and suppression" campaign, but where it is evident that the campaign cannot
be terminated on our interior lines, we should employ the main Red Army force
to break through the enemy's encirclement and switch to our exterior lines
(that is, the enemy's interior lines) in order to defeat him there. Now that
the enemy has developed his blockhouse warfare to a high degree, this will
become our usual method of operation. At the time of the Fukien Incident,
[<A href="#BM37">37</A>] two months after the commencement of our fifth
counter-campaign, the main forces of the Red Army should undoubtedly have
thrust into the Kiangsu-Chekiang-Anhwei-Kiangsi region, with Chekiang as
the centre, and swept over the length and breadth of the area between Hangchow,
Soochow, Nanking, Wuhu, Nanchang and Foochow, turning our strategic defensive
into a strategic offensive, menacing the enemy's vital centres and seeking
battles in the vast areas where there were no blockhouses. By such means
we could have compelled the enemy, who was attacking southern Kiangsi and
western Fukien, to turn back to defend his vital centres, broken his attack
on the base area in Kiangsi and rendered aid to Fukien People's Government--we
certainly could have aided it by this means. As this plan was rejected, the
enemy's fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign could not be broken,
and the People's Government in Fukien inevitably collapsed. Even after a
year's fighting, though it had become inopportune for us to advance on Chekiang,
we could still have turned to the strategic offensive in another direction
by moving our main forces towards Hunan, that is, by driving into central
Hunan instead of going through Hunan to Kweichow, and in this way we could
have manoeuvred the enemy from Kiangsi into Hunan and destroyed him there.
As this plan, too, was rejected, all hope of breaking the enemy's fifth campaign
was finally dashed, and we had no alternative but to set out on the Long
March.
<P>
<P>
<H4>9. WAR OF ANNIHILATION</H4>
<P>
It is inappropriate to advocate a "contest of attrition" for the Chinese
Red Army today. A "contest of treasures" not between Dragon Kings but between
a Dragon King and a beggar would be rather ludicrous. For the Red Army which
gets almost all its supplies from the enemy, war of annihilation is the basic
policy. Only by annihilating the enemy's effective strength can we smash
his "encirclement and suppression" campaigns and expand our revolutionary
base areas. Inflicting casualties is a means of annihilating the enemy, or
otherwise there would be no sense to it. We incur losses ourselves in inflicting
casualties on the enemy, but we replenish ourselves by annihilating his units,
thereby not only making good our losses but adding to the strength of our
army. A battle in which the enemy is routed is not basically decisive in
a contest with a foe of great strength. A battle of annihilation, on the
other hand, produces a great and immediate impact on any enemy. Injuring
all of a man's ten fingers is not as effective as chopping off one, and routing
ten enemy divisions is not as effective as annihilating one of them.
<P>
Our policy for dealing with the enemy's first, second, third and<B> </B>fourth
"encirclement and suppression" campaigns was war of annihilation. The forces
annihilated in each campaign constituted only part of his total strength',
and yet all these "encirclement and suppression" campaigns were smashed.
In our fifth counter-campaign, however, the opposite policy was pursued,
which in fact helped the enemy to attain his aims.
<P>
War of annihilation entails the concentration of superior forces and the
adoption of encircling or outflanking tactics. We cannot have the former
without the latter. Conditions such as popular support, favourable terrain,
a vulnerable enemy force and the advantage of surprise are all indispensable
for the purpose of annihilation.
<P>
Merely routing one enemy force or permitting it to escape has meaning only
if, in the battle or campaign as a whole, our main force is concentrating
its operations of annihilation against another enemy force, or otherwise
it is meaningless. Here the losses are justified by the gains.
<P>
In establishing our own war industry we must not allow ourselves to become
dependent on it. Our basic policy is to rely on the war industries of the
imperialist countries and of our domestic enemy. We have a claim on the output
of the arsenals of London as well as of Hanyang, and, what is more, it is
delivered to us by the enemy's transport corps. This is the sober truth,
it is not a jest.
<H4><em>NOTES</em></H4>
<p class="information"><a name="BM1">1</A>. The science of strategy, the science of campaigns and
the science of tactics are all components of Chinese military science. The
science of strategy deals with the laws that govern the war situation as
a whole. The science of campaigns deals with the laws that govern campaigns
and is applied in directing campaigns. The science of tactics deals with
the laws that govern battles and is applied in directing battles.
<p class="information"><a name="BM2">2</A>. Sun Wu Tzu, or Sun Wu, was a famous Chinese military
scientist in the 5th century B.C., who wrote <em>Sun Tzu</em>, a treatise on
war containing thirteen chapters. This quotation is from Chapter 3, "The
Strategy of Attack".
<p class="information"><a name="BM3">3</A>. When Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote this article in 1936,
it was exactly fifteen years since the founding of the Chinese Communist
Party in July 1921.
<p class="information"><a name="BM4">4</A>. Chen Tu-hsiu was originally a professor at Peking University
and became famous as an editor of <em>New Youth. </em>He was one of the founders
of the Communist Party of China. Owing to his reputation at the time of the
May 4th Movement and owing to the Party's immaturity in its initial period,
he became General Secretary of the Party. In the last period of the revolution
of 1924-27, the Rightist thinking in the Party represented by Chen Tu-hsiu
developed into a line of capitulationism. Comrade Mao Tse-tung has observed
that the capitulationists at that time "voluntarily gave up the Party's
leadership of the peasant masses, urban petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie,
and in particular gave up the Party's leadership of the armed forces, thus
causing the defeat of the revolution" ("The Present Situation and Our Tasks",
<em>Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, </em>Eng. ed., FLP, Peking, 1961, Vol.
IV, p. 171). After the defeat of<B> </B>1927 Chen Tu-hsiu and a handful of
other capitulationists lost faith in the future of the revolution and became
liquidationists. They took the reactionary Trotskyist stand and together
with the Trotskyites formed a small anti-Party group. Consequently Chen Tu-hsiu
was expelled from the Party in November 1929. He died in 1942.
<p class="information"><a name="BM5">5</A>. The "Left" opportunism of Li Li-san, generally known
as the "Li Li-san line", refers to the "Left" opportunist line which existed
in the Party for about four months beginning from June 1930 and which was
represented by Comrade Li Li-san, then the most influential leader of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The Li Li-san line had
the following characteristics: It violated the policy of the Party's Sixth
National Congress; it denied that mass strength had to be built up for the
revolution and denied that the development of the revolution was uneven;
it regarded as "extremely erroneous... localism and conservatism characteristic
of peasant mentality" the ideas of Comrade Mao Tse-tung that for a long time
we should devote our attention mainly to creating rural base areas, use the
rural areas to encircle the cities and use these bases to advance a high
tide of country-wide revolution; and it held that preparations should be
made for immediate insurrections in all parts of the country. On the basis
of this erroneous line, Comrade Li Li-san drew up an adventurist plan for
organizing immediate armed insurrections in the key cities throughout the
country. At the same time, he refused to recognize the uneven development
of the world revolution, holding that the general outbreak of the Chinese
revolution would inevitably lead to a general outbreak of world revolution,
without which the Chinese revolution could not be successful; he also refused
to recognize the protracted nature of China's bourgeois-democratic revolution,
holding that the beginnings of victory in one or more provinces would mark
the beginning of the transition to socialist revolution, and thus formulated
a number of inappropriate "Left" adventurist policies. Comrade Mao Tse-tung
opposed this erroneous line, and the broad masses of cadres and members in
the Party also demanded its rectification. At the Third Plenary Session of
the Party's Sixth Central Committee in September 1930 Comrade Li Li-san admitted
the mistakes that had been pointed out and then relinquished his leading
position in the Central Committee. Over a long period of time Comrade Li
Li-san corrected his wrong views, and so he was re-elected to the Central
Committee at the Seventh National Congress of the Party.
<p class="information"><a name="BM6">6</A>. The Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee
of the Party held in September 1930, and the subsequent central leading body
adopted many positive measures to put an end to the Li Li-san line. But later
a number of Party comrades who were inexperienced in practical revolutionary
struggle, with Chen Shao-yu (Wang Ming) and Chin Pang-hsien (Po Ku) in the
lead, came out against the Central Committee's measures. In the pamphlet,
<em>The Two Lines </em>or <em>The Struggle for the Further</em> <em>Bolshevization
of the Communist Party of China, </em>they most emphatically declared that
the main danger then existing in the Party was not "Left" opportunism but
"Right opportunism" and, to justify their own activities, they "criticized"
the Li Li-san line as "Rightist". They put forward a new political programme
which continued, revived or developed the Li Li-san line and other "Left"
ideas and policies in a new guise, and set themselves against the correct
line of Comrade Mao Tse-tung. It was mainly to criticize the military mistakes
of this new "Left" opportunist line that Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote the present
article "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War". This line was
dominant in the Party from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central
Committee in January 1931 to the meeting of the Political Bureau convened
by the Central Committee at Tsunyi, Kweichow Province, in January 1935, which
ended the dominance of this erroneous line and established the new central
leadership headed by Comrade Mao Tse-tung. The erroneous "Left" line dominated
the Party for a particularly long time (four years) and brought extremely
heavy losses, with disastrous consequences, to the Party and the revolution.
A loss of go per cent was inflicted on the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese
Red Army and its base areas tens of millions of people in the revolutionary
base areas were made to suffer the cruel oppression of the Kuomintang, and
the progress of the Chinese revolution was retarded. The overwhelming majority
of the errant comrades have realized and corrected their mistakes through
a long process of learning from experience and have done much good work for
the Party and the people. Under Comrade Mao Tse-tung's leadership they are
now united with the masses of other comrades in the Party on the basis of
a common political understanding.

set up by Chiang Kai-shek in July 1933 on Lushan Mountain in Kiukiang, Kiangsi
Province, for training anti-Communist military cadres. Officers of Chiang
Kai-shek's armed forces were sent there in rotation to receive fascist military
and political training from German, Italian and American instructors.
<p class="information"><a name="BM9">9</A>. These new military principles largely constituted the

defeated, in which the revolutionary tide in Russia gradually receded. See
<em>History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), Short
Course, </em>Chapter 3, Sections 5 and 6.
<p class="information"><a name="BM17">17</A>. The peace treaty of Brest-Litovsk was concluded between
Soviet Russia and Germany in March 1918. Confronted with obviously superior
enemy forces, the revolutionary forces had to make a temporary retreat in
order to prevent the German imperialists from launching an attack on the
new-born Soviet Republic, which as yet had no army of its own. The conclusion
of this treaty gained time for the Soviet Republic to consolidate the political
power of the proletariat, reorganize its economy and build up the Red Army.
It enabled the proletariat to maintain its leadership over the peasantry
and build up sufficient strength to defeat the White Guards and the armed
intervention of Britain, the United States, France, Japan, Poland and other
countries in 1918-20.
<p class="information"><a name="BM18">18</A>. On October 30, 1927 the peasants of the Haifeng-Lufeng
area of Kwangtung Province launched their third insurrection under the leadership
of the Communist Party of China. They occupied Haifeng and Lufeng and the
surrounding area, organized a Red Army and established the democratic political
power of the workers and peasants. They were later defeated because they
made the mistake of underestimating the enemy.
<p class="information"><a name="BM19">19</A>. The Fourth Front Army and the Second Front Army of
the Red Army joined forces in the autumn of 1936 and shifted northward from
the northeastern part of Sikang. Chang Kuo-tao was then still persisting
in his anti-Party stand and in his policy of retreat and liquidation. In
October of the same year, when the Second and Fourth Front Armies arrived
in Kansu, he ordered the advance units of the Fourth Front Army, numbering
more than 20,000, to organize the Western Column for crossing the Yellow
River and advancing westward to Chinghai. This Column was practically defeated
after suffering blows in battles in December 1936 and was completely defeated
in March 1937.

celebrated Chinese novel describing a peasant war. The novel is attributed
to Shih Nai-an who lived around the end of the Yuan Dynasty and the beginning
of the Ming Dynasty (14th century). Lin Chung and Chai Chin are both heroes
in this novel. Hung is the drill master on Chai Chin's estate.
<p class="information"><a name="BM22">22</A>. Lu and Chi were two feudal states in the Spring and
Autumn Era (722-481 B.C.). Chi was a big state in the central part of the
present Shantung Province, nod Lu was a smaller one in the southern part.
Duke Chuang reigned over Lu from 693 to 662 B.C.

section in <em>Tso </em>Chuan enticed "The loth Year of Duke Chuang" (684 B.C.).
<p class="information"><a name="BM24">24</A>. The ancient town of Chengkao, in the northwest of
the present Chengkao County, Honan Province, was of great military importance.
It was the scene of battles fought in 203 B.C. between Liu Pang, King of
Han, and Hsiang Yu, King of Chu. At first Hsiang Yu captured Hsingyang and
Chengkao and Liu Pang's troops were almost routed. Liu Pang waited until
the opportune moment when Hsiang Yu's troops were in midstream crossing the
Szeshui River, and then crushed them and recaptured Chengkao.
<p class="information"><a name="BM25">25</A>. The ancient town of Kunyang, in the north of the present
Yehhsien County, Honan Province, was the place where Liu Hsiu, founder of
the Eastern Han Dynasty, defeated the troops of Wang Mang, Emperor of the
Hsin Dynasty, in A.D. 23. There was a huge numerical disparity between the
two sides, Liu Hsiu's forces totalling 8,000 to 9,000 men as against Wang
Mang's 400,000. But taking advantage of the negligence of Wang Mang's generals,
Wang Hsun and Wang Yi, who underestimated the enemy, Liu Hsiu with only 3,000
picked troops put Wang Mang's main forces to rout. He followed up this victory
by crushing the rest of the enemy troops.
<p class="information"><a name="BM26">26</A>. Kuantu was in the northeast of the present Chungmou
County, Honan Province, and the scene of the battle between the armies of
Tsao Tsao and Yuan Shao in A.D. 200. Yuan Shao had an army of 100,000 while
Tsao Tsao had only a meagre force and was short of supplies. Taking advantage
of lack of vigilance on the part of Yuan Shao's troops, who belittled the
enemy, Tsao Tsao dispatched his light-footed soldiers to spring a surprise
attack on them and set their supplies on fire. Yuan Shao's army was thrown
into confusion and its main force wiped out.
<p class="information"><a name="BM27">27</A>. The state of Wu was ruled by Sun Chuan, and the state
of Wei by Tsao Tsao. Chihpi is situated on the south bank of the Yangtse
River, to the northeast of Chinyni Hupeh Province. In A.D. 208 Tsao Tsao
led an army of over 500,000 men, which he proclaimed to be 800,000 strong,
to launch an attack on Sun Chuan. The latter, in alliance with<B> </B>Tsao
Tsao's antagonist Liu Pei, mustered a force of 30,000. Knowing that Tsao
Tsao's army was plagued by epidemics and was unaccustomed to action<B>
</B>afloat, the allied forces of Sun Chuan and Liu Pei set fire to Tsao Tsao's
fleet and crushed his army.
<p class="information"><a name="BM28">28</A>. Yiling, to the east of the present Ichang, Hupeh Province,
was the place where<B> </B>Lu Hsun, a general of the state of Wu, defeated
the army of Liu Pei, ruler of Shu, in A.D. 222. Liu Pei's troops scored
successive victories at the beginning of the war and<B> </B>penetrated five
or six hundred li into the territory of Wu as far as Yiling. Lu Hsun, who
was defending Yiling, avoided battle for over seven months until Liu Pei
"was at his<B> </B>wits' end and his troops were exhausted and demoralized".
Then he<B> </B>crushed Liu Pei's troops by taking advantage of a favourable
wind to set fire to their tents.
<p class="information"><a name="BM29">29</A>. Hsieh Hsuan, a general of Eastern Tsin Dynasty, defeated
Pu Chien, ruler of<B> </B>the state of Chin, in A.D. 383 at the Peishui River
in Anhwei Province. Pu Chien had an infantry force of more than 600,000,
a cavalry force of 270,000 and a guards corps of more than 30,000, while
the land and river forces of Eastern Tsin numbered only 80,000. When the
armies lined up on opposite banks of the Peishui River, Hsieh Hsuan, taking
advantage of the overconfidence and conceit of the enemy troops, requested
Pu Chien to move his troops back so as to leave room for the Eastern Tsin
troops to cross the river and fight it out. Pu Chien complied, but when he
ordered withdrawal, his troops got into a panic and could not be stopped.
Seizing the opportunity, the Eastern Tsin troops crossed the river, launched
an offensive and crushed the enemy.
<p class="information"><a name="BM30">30</A>. Nanchang, capital of Kiangsi Province, was the scene
of the famous uprising on August l, 1927 led by the Communist Party of China
in order to combat the counterrevolution of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei
and to continue the revolution of 1924-27. More than thirty thousand troops
took part in the uprising which was led by Comrades Chou En-lai, Chu The,
Ho Lung and Yeh Ting. The insurrectionary army withdrew from Nanchang on
August 5 as planned, but suffered a defeat when approaching Chaochow and
Swatow in Kwangtung Province. Led by Comrades Chu Teh, Chen Yi and Lin Piao,
part of the troops later fought their way to the Chingkang Mountains and
joined forces with the 1st Division of the First Workers' and Peasants'
Revolutionary Army under Comrade Mao Tse-tung.

in China?", Note 8, p. 72 of this volume.
<p class="information"><a name="BM32">32</A>. The famous Autumn Harvest Uprising under the leadership
of Comrade Mao Tse-tung was launched in September 1927 by the people's armed
forces of Hsiushui, Pinghsiang, Pingkiang and Liuyang Counties on the
Hunan-Kiangd border, who formed the 1st Division of the First Workers' and
Peasants' Revolutionary Army. Comrade Mao Tse-tung led this force to the
Chingkang Mountains where a revolutionary base was established.
<p class="information"><a name="BM33">33</A>. The A-B (initials for "Anti-Bolshevik") Group was

<p class="information"><a name="BM36">36</A>. The "eight-legged essay" was the prescribed form in
the imperial competitive examinations in feudal China from the 15th to the
19th century. The main body of the essay was made up of the inceptive paragraph,
the middle paragraph, the rear paragraph and the concluding paragraph, with
each paragraph comprising two parts. Here Comrade Mao Tse-tung is using the
development of the theme in this kind of essay as a metaphor to illustrate
the development of the revolution through its various stages. However, Comrade
Mao Tse-tung generally uses the term "eight-legged essay" to ridicule dogmatism.
<p class="information"><a name="BM37">37</A>. In November 1933, under the influence of the people's
anti-Japanese upsurge throughout China, the leaders of the Kuomintang's 19th
Route Army, in alliance with the Kuomintang forces under Li Chi-shen, publicly
renounced Chiang Kai-shek and established the "People's Revolutionary Government
of the Republic of China" in Fukien, concluding an agreement with the Red
Army to attack Chiang Kai-shek and resist Japan. This episode was referred
to as the Fukien Incident. The 19th Route Army and Fukien People's Government,
however, collapsed under the attacks of Chiang Kai-shek's troops.
