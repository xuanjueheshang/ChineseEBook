[This article was a resolution drawn up by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Ninth
Party Congress of the Fourth Army of the Red Army. The building of the Chinese
people's armed forces was a difficult process. The Chinese Red Army (which
became the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies during the War of Resistance
Against Japan and is now the People's Liberation Army) was created on August
1, 1927, during the Nanchang Uprising, and by December 1929 had been in existence
for over two years. During this period the Communist Party organization in
the Red army learned a great deal and gained quite a rich store of experience
in the course of combating various mistaken ideas. The resolution summed
up this experience. It enabled the Red Army to build itself entirely on a
Marxist-Leninist basis and to eliminate all the influences of armies of the
old type. It was carried out not only in the Fourth Army but also in all
other units of the Red Army successively, in this way the whole Chinese Red
Army became a genuine army of the people in every respect. In the last thirty
years or so the Chinese people's armed forces have made tremendous developments
and innovations in their Party activities and political work which now present
a very different picture, but the basic line remains the same as that laid
down in this resolution.]
<P>
  <hr class="end">
<P>
There are various non-proletarian ideas in the Communist Party organization
in the Fourth Red Army which greatly hinder the application of the Party's
correct line. Unless these ideas are thoroughly corrected, the Fourth Army
cannot possibly shoulder the tasks assigned to it in China's great revolutionary
struggle. The source of such incorrect ideas in this Party organization lies,
of course, in the fact that its basic units are composed largely of peasants
and other elements of petty-bourgeois origin; yet the failure of the Party's
leading bodies to wage a concerted and determined struggle against these
incorrect ideas and to educate the members in the Party's correct line is
also an important cause of their existence and growth. In accordance with
the spirit of the September letter of the Central Committee, this congress
hereby points out the manifestations of various non-proletarian ideas in
the Party organization in the Fourth Army, their sources, and the methods
of correcting them, and calls upon all comrades to eliminate them thoroughly.
<H3><A name="s1">ON THE PURELY MILITARY VIEWPOINT</A></H3>
<P>
The purely military viewpoint is very highly developed among a number of
comrades in the Red Army. It manifests itself as follows:
<P>
1. These comrades regard military affairs and politics as opposed to each
other and refuse to recognize that military affairs are only one means of
accomplishing political tasks. Some even say, "If you are good militarily,
naturally you are good politically; if you are not good militarily, you cannot
be any good politically"--this is to go a step further and give military
affairs a leading position over politics.
<P>
2. They think that the task of the Red Army like that of the White army,
is merely to fight. They do not understand that the Chinese Red Army is an
armed body for carrying out the political tasks of the revolution. Especially
at present, the Red Army should certainly not confine itself to fighting;
besides fighting to destroy the enemy's military strength, it should shoulder
such important tasks as doing propaganda among the masses, organizing the
masses, arming them, helping them to establish revolutionary political power
and setting up Party organizations. The Red Army fights not merely for the
sake of fighting but in order to conduct propaganda among the masses, organize
them, arm them, and help them to establish revolutionary political power.
Without these objectives, fighting loses its meaning and the Red Army loses
the reason for its existence.
<P>
3. Hence, organizationally, these comrades subordinate the departments of
the Red Army doing political work to those doing military work, and put forward
the slogan, "Let Army Headquarters handle outside matters." If allowed to
develop, this idea would involve the danger of estrangement from the masses,
control of the government by the army and departure from proletarian leadership--
it would be to take the path of warlordism like the Kuomintang army.
<P>
4. At the same time, in propaganda work they overlook the importance of
propaganda teams. On the question of mass organization, they neglect the
organizing of soldiers' committees in the army and the organizing of the
local workers and peasants. As a result, both propaganda and organizational
work are abandoned.
<P>
5. They become conceited when a battle is won and dispirited when a battle
is lost.
<P>
6. Selfish departmentalism--they think only of the Fourth Army and do not
realize that it is an important task of the Red Army to arm the local masses.
This is cliquism in a magnified form.
<P>
7. Unable to see beyond their limited environment in the Fourth Army, a few
comrades believe that no other revolutionary forces exist. Hence their extreme
addiction to the idea of conserving strength and avoiding action. This is
a remnant of opportunism.
<P>
8. Some comrades, disregarding the subjective and objective conditions, suffer
from the malady of revolutionary impetuosity; they will not take pains to
do minute and detailed work among the masses, but, riddled with illusions,
want only to do big things. This is a remnant of
putschism.[<A href="#n1">1</A>]
<P>
The sources of the purely military viewpoint are:
<P>
1. A low political level. From this flows the failure to recognize the role
of political leadership in the army and to recognize that the Red Army and
the White army are fundamentally different.
<P>
2. The mentality of mercenaries. Many prisoners captured in past battles
have joined the Red Army, and such elements bring with them a markedly mercenary
outlook, thereby providing a basis in the lower<B> </B>ranks for the purely
military viewpoint.
<P>
3. From the two preceding causes there arises a third, overconfidence in
military strength and absence of confidence in the strength of the masses
of the people.
<P>
4 The Party's failure actively to attend to and discuss military work is
also a reason for the emergence of the purely military viewpoint among a
number of comrades.
<P>
The methods of correction are as follows:
<P>
1. Raise the political level in the Party by means of education, destroy
the theoretical roots of the purely military viewpoint, and be dear on the
fundamental difference between the Red Army and the White army. At the same
time, eliminate the remnants of opportunism and putschism and break down
the selfish departmentalism of the Fourth Army.
<P>
2. Intensify the political training of officers and men and especially the
education of ex-prisoners. At the same time, as far as possible let the local
governments select workers and peasants experienced in struggle to join the
Red Army, thus organizationally weakening or even eradicating the purely
military viewpoint.
<P>
3. Arouse the local Party organizations to criticize the Party organizations
in the Red Army and the organs of mass political power to criticize the Red
Army itself, in order to influence the Party organizations and the officers
and men of the Red Army.
<P>
4. The Party must actively attend to and discuss military work. All the work
must be discussed and decided upon by the Party before being carried out
by the rank and file.
<P>
5. Draw up Red Army rules and regulations which dearly define its tasks,
the relationship between its military and its political apparatus, the
relationship between the Red Army and the masses of the people, and the powers
and functions of the soldiers' committees and their relationship with the
military and political organizations.
<P>
<H3><A name="s2">ON ULTRA-DEMOCRACY </A></H3>
<P>
Since the Fourth Army of the Red Army accepted the directives of the Central
Committee, there has been a great decrease in the manifestations of
ultra-democracy. For example, Party decisions are now carried out fairly
well; and no longer does anyone bring up such erroneous demands as that the
Red Army should apply "democratic centralism from the bottom to the top"
or should "let the lower levels discuss all problems first, and then let
the higher levels decide". Actually, however, this decrease is only temporary
and superficial and does not mean that ultra-democratic ideas have already
been eliminated. In other words, ultra-democracy is still deep-rooted in
the minds of many comrades. Witness the various expressions of reluctance
to carry out Party decisions.
<P>
The methods of correction are as follows:
<P>
1. In the sphere of theory, destroy the roots of ultra-democracy. First,
it should be pointed out that the danger of ultra-democracy lies in the fact
that it damages or even completely wrecks the Party organization and weakens
or even completely undermines the Party's fighting capacity, rendering the
Party incapable of fulfilling its fighting tasks and thereby causing the
defeat of the revolution. Next, it should be pointed out that the source
of ultra-democracy consists in the petty bourgeoisie's individualistic aversion
to discipline. When this characteristic is brought into the Party, it develops
into ultra-democratic ideas politically and organizationally. These ideas
are utterly incompatible with the fighting tasks of the proletariat.
<P>
2. In the sphere of organization, ensure democracy under centralized guidance.
It should be done on the following lines:
<P>
(1) The leading bodies of the Party must give a correct line of guidance
and kind solutions when problems arise, in order to establish themselves
as centres of leadership.
<P>
(2) The higher bodies must be familiar with the life of the masses and with
the situation in the lower bodies so as to have an objective basis for correct
guidance.
<P>
(3) No Party organization at any level should make casual decisions in solving
problems. Once a decision is reached, it must be firmly carried out.
<P>
(4) All decisions of any importance made by the Party's higher bodies must
be promptly transmitted to the lower bodies and the Party rank and file.
The method is to call meetings of activists or general membership meetings
of the Party branches or even of the columns [<A href="#n2">2</A>] (when
circumstances permit) and to assign people to make reports at such meetings.
<P>
(5) The lower bodies of the Party and the Party rank and file must discuss
the higher bodies' directives in detail in order to understand their meaning
thoroughly and decide on the methods<B> </B>of carrying them out.
<H3><A name="s3">ON THE DISREGARD OF ORGANIZATIONAL DISCIPLINE</A></H3>
<P>
Disregard of organizational discipline in the Party organization in the Fourth
Army manifests itself as follows:
<P>
A. Failure of the minority to submit to the majority. For example, when a
minority finds its motion voted down, it does not sincerely carry out the
Party decisions.
<P>
The methods of correction are as follows:
<P>
1. At meetings, all participants should be encouraged to voice their opinions
as fully as possible. The rights and wrongs in any controversy should be
clarified without compromise or glossing over. In order to reach a clear-cut
conclusion, what cannot be settled at one meeting should be discussed at
another, provided there is no interference with the work.
<P>
2. One requirement of Party discipline is that the minority should submit
to the majority. If the view of the minority has been rejected, it must support
the decision passed by the majority. If necessary, it can bring up the maker
for reconsideration at the next meeting, but apart from that it must not
act against the decision in any way.
<P>
B. Criticism made without regard to organizational discipline:
<P>
1. Inner-Party criticism is a weapon for strengthening the Party organization
and increasing its fighting capacity. In the Party organization of the Red
Army, however, criticism is not always of this character, and sometimes turns
into personal attack. As a result, it damages the Party organization as well
as individuals. This is a manifestation of petty-bourgeois individualism.
The method of correction is to help Party members understand that the purpose
of criticism is to increase the Party's fighting capacity in order to achieve
victory in the class struggle and that it should not be used as a means of
personal attack.
<P>
2. Many Party members make their criticisms not inside, but outside, the
Party. The reason is that the general membership has not yet grasped the
importance of the Party organization (its meetings and so forth), and sees
no difference between criticism inside and outside the organization. The
method of correction is to educate Party members so that they understand
the importance of Party organization and make their criticisms of Party
committees or comrades at Party meetings.
<H3><A name="s4">ON ABSOLUTE EQUALITARIANISM</A></H3>
<P>
Absolute equalitarianism became quite serious in the Red Army at one time.
Here are some examples. On the matter of allowances to wounded soldiers,
there were objections to differentiating between light and serious cases,
and the demand was raised for equal allowances for all. When officers rode
on horseback, it was regarded not as something necessary for performing their
duties but as a sign of inequality. Absolutely equal distribution of supplies
was demanded, and there was objection to somewhat larger allotments in special
cases. In the hauling of rice, the demand was made that all should carry
the same load on their backs, irrespective of age or physical condition.
Equality was demanded in the allotment of billets, and the Headquarters would
be abused for occupying larger rooms. Equality was demanded in the assignment
of fatigue duties, and there was unwillingness to do a little more than the
next man. It even went so far that when there were two wounded men but only
one stretcher, neither could be carried away because each refused to yield
priority to the other. Absolute equalitarianism, as shown in these examples,
is still very serious among officers and soldiers of the Red Army.
<P>
Absolute equalitarianism, like ultra-democracy in political matters, is the
product of a handicraft and small peasant economy--the only difference being
that the one manifests itself in material affairs, while the other manifests
itself in political affairs.
<P>
The method of correction: We should point out that, before the abolition
of capitalism, absolute equalitarianism is a mere illusion of peasants and
small proprietors, and that even under socialism there can be no absolute
equality, for material things will then be distributed on the principle of
"from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" as well
as on that of meeting the needs of the work. The distribution of material
things in the Red Army must be more or less equal, as in the case of equal
pay for officers and men, because this is required by the present circumstances
of the struggle. But absolute equalitarianism beyond reason must be opposed
because it is not required by the struggle; on the contrary, it hinders the
struggle.
<H3><A name="s5">ON SUBJECTIVISM</A> </H3>
<P>
Subjectivism exists to a serious degree among some Party members, causing
great harm to the analysis of the political situation and the guidance of
the work. The reason is that subjective analysis of a political situation
and subjective guidance of work inevitably result either in opportunism or
in putschism. As for subjective criticism, loose and groundless talk or
suspiciousness, such practices inside the Party often breed unprincipled
disputes and undermine the Party organization.
<P>
Another point that should be mentioned in connection with inner-Party criticism
is that some comrades ignore the major issues and confine their attention
to minor points when they make their criticism. They do not understand that
the main task of criticism is to point out political and organizational mistakes.
As to personal shortcomings, unless they are related to political and
organizational mistakes, there is no need to be overcritical and to embarrass
the comrades concerned. Moreover, once such criticism develops, there is
the great danger that the Party members will concentrate entirely on minor
faults, and everyone will become timid and overcautious and forget the Party's
political tasks.
<P>
The main method of correction is to educate Party members so that a political
and scientific spirit pervades their thinking and their Party life. To this
end we must: (1) teach Party members to apply the Marxist-Leninist method
in analysing a political situation and appraising the class forces, instead
of making a subjective analysis and appraisal; (2) direct the attention of
Party members to social and economic investigation and study, so as to determine
the tactics of struggle and methods of work, and help comrades to understand
that without investigation of actual conditions they will fall into the pit
of fantasy and putschism; and (3) in inner-Party criticism, guard against
subjectivism, arbitrariness and the vulgarization of criticism; statements
should be based on facts and criticism should centre on politics.
<H3><A name="s6">ON INDIVIDUALISM</A>
</H3>
<P>
The tendency towards individualism in the Red Army Party organization manifests
itself as follows:
<P>
1. Retaliation. Some comrades, after being criticized inside the Party by
a soldier comrade, look for opportunities to retaliate outside the Party,
and one way is to beat or abuse the comrade in question. They also seek to
retaliate within the Party. "You have criticized me at this meeting, so I'll
find some way to pay you back at the next." Such retaliation arises from
purely personal considerations, to the neglect of the interests of the class
and of the Party as a whole. Its target is not the enemy class, but individuals
in our own ranks. It is a corrosive which weakens the organization and its
fighting capacity.
<P>
2. "Small group" mentality. Some comrades consider only the interests of
their own small group and ignore the general interest. Although on the surface
this does not seem to be the pursuit of personal interests, in reality it
exemplifies the narrowest individualism and has a strong corrosive and
centrifugal effect. "Small group" mentality used to be rife in the Red Army,
and although there has been some improvement as a result of criticism, there
are still survivals and further effort is needed to overcome it.
<P>
3. The "employee" mentality. Some comrades do not understand that the Party
and the Red Army, of which they are members, are both instruments for carrying
out the tasks of the revolution. They do not realize that they themselves
are makers of the revolution, but think that their responsibility is merely
to their individual superiors and not to the revolution. This passive mentality
of an "employee" of the revolution is also a manifestation of individualism.
It explains why there are not very many activists who work unconditionally
for the revolution. Unless it is eliminated, the number of activists will
not grow and the heavy burden of the revolution will remain on the shoulders
of a small number of people, much to the detriment of the struggle.
<P>
4. Pleasure-seeking. In the Red Army there are also quite a few people whose
individualism finds expression in pleasure-seeking. They always hope that
their unit will march into big cities. They want to go there not to work
but to enjoy themselves. The last thing they want is to work in the Red areas
where life is hard.
<P>
5. Passivity. Some comrades become passive and stop working whenever anything
goes against their wishes. This is mainly due to. lack of education, though
sometimes it is also due to the leadership's improper conduct of affairs,
assignment of work or enforcement of discipline.
<P>
6. The desire to leave the army. The number of people who ask for transfers
from the Red Army to local work is on the increase The reason for this does
not lie entirely with the individuals but also with: (1) the material hardships
of life in the Red Army, (2) exhaustion after long struggle, and (3) the
leadership's improper conduct of affairs, assignment of work or enforcement
of discipline.
<P>
The method of correction is primarily to strengthen education so as to rectify
individualism ideologically. Next, it is to conduct affairs, make assignments
and enforce discipline in a proper way. In addition, ways must be found to
improve the material life of the Red Army, and every available opportunity
must be utilized for rest and rehabilitation in order to improve material
conditions. In our educational work we must explain that in its social origin
individualism is a reflection within the Party of petty-bourgeois and bourgeois
ideas.
<H3><A name="s7">ON THE IDEOLOGY OF ROVING REBEL BANDS</A></H3>
<P>
The political ideology of roving rebel bands has emerged in the Red Army
because the proportion of vagabond elements is large and because there are
great masses of vagabonds in China, especially in the southern provinces.
This ideology manifests itself as follows: (1) Some people want to increase
our political influence only by means of roving guerrilla actions, but are
unwilling to increase it by undertaking the arduous task of building up base
areas and establishing the people's political power. (2) In expanding the
Red Army, some people follow the line of "hiring men and buying horses" and
"recruiting deserters and accepting mutineers", [<A href="#n3">3</A>] rather
than the line of expanding the local Red Guards and the local troops and
thus developing the main forces of the Red Army. (3) Some people lack the
patience to carry on arduous struggles together with the masses, and only
want to go to the big cities to eat and drink to their hearts' content. All
these manifestations of the ideology of roving rebels seriously hamper the
Red Army in performing its proper tasks; consequently its eradication is
an important objective in the ideological struggle within the Red Army Party
organization. It must be understood that the ways of roving rebels of the
Huang Chao [<A href="#n5">4</A>] or Li Chuang [<A href="#n5">5</A>] type
are not permissible under present-day conditions.
<P>
The methods of correction are as follows:
<P>
1. Intensify education, criticize incorrect ideas, and eradicate the ideology
of roving rebel bands.
<P>
2. Intensify education among the basic sections of the Red Army and among
recently recruited captives to counter the vagabond outlook.
<P>
3. Draw active workers and peasants experienced in struggle into the ranks
of the Red Army so as to change its composition.
<P>
4. Create new units of the Red Army from among the masses of militant workers
and peasants.
<P>
<H3><A name="s8">ON THE REMNANTS OF PUTSCHISM</A></H3>
<P>
The Party organization in the Red Army has already waged struggles against
putschism, but not yet to a sufficient extent. Therefore, remnants of this
ideology still exist in the Red Army. Their manifestations are: (1) blind
action regardless of subjective and objective conditions; (2) inadequate
and irresolute application of the Party's policies for the cities; (3) slack
military discipline, especially in moments of defeat; (4) acts of house-burning
by some units; and (5) the practices of shooting deserters and of inflicting
corporal punishment, both of which smack of putschism. In its social origins,
putschism is a combination of <I>lumpen</I>-proletarian and petty- bourgeois
ideology.
<P>
The methods of correction are as follows:
<P>
1. Eradicate putschism ideologically.
<P>
2. Correct putschist behaviour through rules, regulations and policies.
<H4 ALIGN=Center>
  <I>NOTES</I>
</H4>
<p class="information"><A name="n1">1</A>. For a brief period after the defeat of the revolution
in 1927, a "Left" putschist tendency arose in the Communist Party. Regarding
the Chinese revolution as a "permanent revolution" and the revolutionary
situation in China as a "permanent upsurge", the putschist comrades refused
to organize an orderly retreat and, adopting the methods of commandism and
relying only on a small number of Party members and a small section of the
masses, erroneously attempted to stage a series of local uprisings throughout
the country, which had no prospect of success. Such putschist activities
were widespread at the end of 1927 but gradually subsided in the beginning
of 1928, though sentiments in favour of putschism still survived among some
comrades.
<p class="information"><A name="n2">2</A> In the guerrilla system of organization a column corresponded
to a division in the regular army, with a complement much more flexible and
usually much smaller than that of a regular division.
<p class="information"><A name="n3">3</A> These two Chinese idioms refer to the methods which some
rebels in Chinese history adopted to expand their forces. In the application
of these methods, attention was paid to numbers rather than to quality, and
people of all sorts were indiscriminately recruited to swell the ranks.
<p class="information"><A name="n4">4</A> Huang Chao was the leader of the peasant revolts towards
the end of the Tang Dynasty. In A.D. 875, starting from his home district
Tsaochow (now Hotse County in Shantung), Huang led armed peasants in victorious
battles against the imperial forces and styled himself the "Heaven-Storming
General". In the course of a decade he swept over most of the provinces in
the Yellow, Yangtse, Huai and Pearl river valleys, reaching as far as Kwangsi.
He finally broke through the Tungkuan pass, captured the imperial capital
of Changan (now Sian in Shensi), and was crowned Emperor of Chi. Internal
dissensions and attacks by the non-Han tribal allies of the Tang forces compelled
Huang to abandon Changan and retreat to his native district, where he committed
suicide. The ten years' war fought by him is one of the most famous peasant
wars in Chinese history. Dynastic historians record that "all people suffering
from heavy taxes and levies rallied to him". But as he merely carried on
roving warfare without ever establishing relatively consolidated base areas,
his forces were called "roving rebel bands".
<p class="information"><A name="n5">5</A> Li Chuang, short for Li Tzu-cheng the King Chuang<B>
</B>(the Dare-All King), native of Michih, northern Shensi, was the leader
of a peasant revolt which led to the overthrow of the Ming Dynasty. The revolt
first started in northern Shensi in 1628. Li joined the forces led by Kao
Ying-hsiang and campaigned through Honan and Anhwei and back to Shensi. After
Kao's death in 1636, Li succeeded him, becoming King Chuang, and campaigned
in and out of the provinces of Shensi, Szechuan, Honan and Hupeh Finally
he captured the imperial capital of Peking in 1644, whereupon the last Ming
emperor committed suicide. The chief slogan he spread among the masses was
"Support King Chuang, and pay no grain taxes". Another slogan of his to enforce
discipline among his men ran: "Any murder means the killing of my father,
any rape means the violation of my mother." Thus he won the support of the
masses and his movement became the main current of the peasant revolts raging
all over the country. As he, too, roamed about without ever establishing
relatively consolidated base areas, he was eventually defeated by Wu San-kuei,
a Ming general who colluded with the Ching troops in a joint aback on Li.
