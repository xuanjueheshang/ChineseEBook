<p>This is an old article which was written to oppose dogmatism in the Red Army at that time. At that time we did not use the term <em>Chiao-t&#8217;iao-chu-i</em> (dogmatism) but rather <em>Pen-pen-Chu-I</em> (bookworship). The article was written approximately in the spring of 1930. It has already been 30 years since I have read it. In January 1961, I suddenly found it in the Central Revolutionary Museum. The Central Revolutionary Museum had found it in the Fukien Lung Yen Area committee. In reading it I find that it still has some use, so I have had printed a good many copies as reference for comrades.</p>
