<p>Huan Hsiang&#8217;s theory is correct. The Western World is disintegrating. Currently it is in the process of breaking up, though not yet completely. But is heading in that direction. Final disintegration is inevitable. The transitional period may last quite a while; it will not happen overnight. The so-called Western unity is an empty term. There is unity; Dulles is striving for it, but it has to be under U.S. control. Under the atomic bomb, the big and small partners must rally around the U.S., pay tribute, and prostrate themselves as inferiors. This is the so-called unity of the Americans. Such a situation will inevitably head toward the opposite of unity, to disintegration. Comrades, under today&#8217;s situation, to whom does the world belong?!</p>
