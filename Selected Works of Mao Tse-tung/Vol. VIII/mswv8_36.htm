<p>. . . Confusion. It&#8217;s like drawing water from a well by means of 15 buckets, seven of them coming up and the other eight going down. [You] are being tied up by others and can&#8217;t get free. You are getting the consequences of your own doings. Whom can you blame? In my opinion, you have relapsed into your old illness. You haven&#8217;t got rid of the original germs of your old and old disease of malaria. Now you are having spells of cold and fever again. A scholar of former days composed a poem on malaria as follows: &#8220;When the spell of cold comes, one feels as if sleeping on the ice. When the spell of fever comes, one feels as if sitting in a cooking steamer. When pain comes, one feels that one&#8217;s scalp is cracking. When one trembles, one has to grind one&#8217;s teeth. It hurts so much, it hurts so much. Really one passes the difficult time of winter and summer back and forth.&#8221; Comrade, is not like this? If so, then that is fine. One like you needs to go through a serious illness. In the <em>Literary Selections of Chao Ming</em>, Vol. 34, Mei Sheng&#8217;s &#8220;<em>Chi Fa</em>&#8221; <span class= "info">[<a name= "b1" href="#n1">1</a>]</span> says in its last part; &#8220;This is also an important saying and wonderful truth in the world. My prince, wouldn&#8217;t you want to hear it? Then, the Prince arose from the bed and said: &#8216;After I have heard what the sage scholar said, I have perspired, and my illness is entirely gone.&#8217; &#8221; Your illness is similar to that of this prince of the Chu Kingdom. If you are interested in, you may read Mei Sheng&#8217;s &#8220;<em>Chi Fa</em>&#8221;. Indeed, it&#8217;s a wonderful literary piece. You have entirely forgotten the important saying and wonderful truth of Marxism. Therefore, you joined the Military Club, truly a combination of men of civil and military services. What is to be done now? Comrade, I would like to give you a piece of advice: &#8220;Thoroughly rectify yourself.&#8221; Thanks to your courtesy in calling!
 me over the telephone several times and saying that you wished to come to my place to talk to me. I am willing to talk with you but I am busy these days. You&#8217;ll have to wait for some other day. I have written this letter first to give you a piece of my sincere thought.</p>
