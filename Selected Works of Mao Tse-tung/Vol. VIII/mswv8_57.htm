<p>The principles of educating youth are:</p>

<p>1. Teach them to grasp Marxism-Leninism and to overcome petit-bourgeois consciousness.</p>

<p>2. Teach them to have discipline and organization and to oppose anarchism and liberatarianism in organization.</p>

<p>3. Teach them to penetrate resolutely into the lower levels of practical work and to oppose looking down on practical experience.</p>

<p>4. Teach them to become close to the workers and peasants, to serve them resolutely, and to oppose the consciousness of looking down on workers and peasants.</p>
