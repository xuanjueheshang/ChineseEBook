<hr class="end" />

<p>The mass movements of technical revolution and cultural revolution on our industrial and communication fronts, agricultural, forestry, livestock, subsidiary products, and pisciculture fronts, finance and trade fronts, education and health fronts and national defense are fiercely developing. New hope and new things are emerging in abundance. We urge you to examine them carefully, be ready to sum up, and popularize them.</p>
