<H3>Comment On Two Reports: &#8220;The Situation Of Wang-kuo-fan Commune Has Always Been Very Good&#8221; And &#8220;Who Are The People Engaged In Idle Talks Now In The Countryside&#8221;</H3>

<p>Print and circulate these two articles among the comrades. The comrades of Party committees of all provinces, municipalities and districts are requested to print and circulate the report on Wang-kuo-fan Commune among all Party committees of people&#8217;s communes with necessary introductory notes. All Party committees of communes are requested to study it and see what experiences from it can be adopted by them. In my opinion, all of them can be adopted: First, run the commune with diligence and frugality; second, raise more pigs (except Moslems who keep no pigs); third, breed more big animals; fourth, increase the number of big farm tools; fifth, mess-hall operation; sixth, do work on a solid ground by seeking truth from facts; and seventh consult with the masses on anything and persist in the mass line. All these are very good. I believe that in every special district there must be one or several communes which are well run as the Wang-kuo-fan Commune. You are requested to try carefully to find them out. When you have found them, you are to study them, write articles for publication and publicize their experiences. This article on &#8220;Who Are the People Engaged in Idle Talks Now in the Countryside&#8221; is also worthwhile to read. They are connected with those who are now engaged in idle talking at Lushan.</p>
