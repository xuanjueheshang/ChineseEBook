<h4>Lo Fu&#8217;s Farewell Message to Mao Tse-tung<br />on the Morning of 18 August</H4>

<p>Comrade Tse-tung:</p>

<p>I have just undergone a major operation, which should be beneficial to my health. I sincerely thank you and other comrades of the Central Committee for your help. I must sever relations with my reactionary self of yesterday. Today, I read your comments on Mei Sheng&#8217;s essay, &#8220;<em>Ch&#8217;i Fa</em>&#8221;, on machine guns and other subjects, and was greatly moved.</p>

<p>I did not call on you because I did not receive any notification from you. I descend the hills today. I hope to see you in Peking and to receive more instructions from you.</p>

<p class= inline>Chang Wen-t&#8217;ien</p>
