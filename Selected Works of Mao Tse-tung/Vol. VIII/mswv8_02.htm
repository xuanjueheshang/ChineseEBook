<p class= "fst">Comrades Liu Chien-hsun<span class= "info">[<a name= "b1" href="#n1">1</a>]</span> and Wei Kuo-ch&#8217;ing,</p>

<p>Here attached for your reference are a few copies of local papers each one of which has its characteristics and is well edited. They are attractive to the reader and their contents are good.</p>

<p>Provincial newspapers are an exceedingly important problem which deserves careful study. A solution can be found in a few months if you work with the editors of the <EM>Kwangsi Daily</EM> (&#8216;Kwanghsi Jih-pao&#8217;), to study the format, news items, editorials, features on theoretical problems, and literature and art [supplements], and think and analyze [these] over and over again, and if you compare it with other provincial newspapers. Careful writing of editorials is extremely important work. This must be studied by you, by the head of the propaganda department, the secretary-general, and the editor-in-chief of the newspaper. It is imperative that the first secretary must have full authority in revising major editorials. The papers will help to organize, encourage, stimulate, criticize, and promote the work of all the people in a province. Would you like to give some thought to this problem.</p>
