Comrade William Z. Foster and the National Committee of the Communist Party
of the United States of America:
<P>
We are glad to learn that the special convention of the Communist Political
Association of the United States has resolved to repudiate Browder's revisionist,
that is, capitulationist line, <B>[<A HREF="#bm1">1</A>]</B> has re-established
Marxist leadership and revived the Communist Party of the United States.
We hereby extend to you our warm congratulations on this great victory of
the working class and the Marxist movement in the United States. Browder's
whole revisionist-capitulationist line (which is fully expressed in his book
<EM>Teheran) </EM>in essence reflects the influence of reactionary U.S.
capitalist groups on the U.S. workers' movement. These groups are now doing
their utmost to extend their influence in China too; they are supporting
the erroneous policy of the reactionary clique inside the Kuomintang, a policy
which is against the interests of the nation and the people, and are thereby
confronting the Chinese people with the grave danger of civil war and
jeopardizing the interests of the peoples of our two great countries, China
and the United States. Beyond all doubt the victory of the U.S. working class
and its vanguard, the Communist Party of the United States, over Browder's
revisionist-capitulationist line will contribute signally to the great cause
in which the Chinese and American peoples are engaged the cause of carrying
on the war against Japan and of building a peaceful and democratic world
after the war.
<H4><I>NOTES</I></H4>
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm1">1.</A> Earl Browder was the General Secretary of the Communist
Party of the United States of America from 1930 to 1944. During World War
II, the Rightist ideas in the Communist Party of the U.S.A., of which Browder
was the chief exponent, developed into an anti-Marxist
revisionist-capitulationist line. From December 1943 onward, Browder advocated
this line in a number of speeches and articles and in April 1944 he published
<EM>Teheran, </EM>as his Right opportunist programme. Revising the basic
Leninist thesis that imperialism is monopolistic, decadent and moribund
capitalism, and denying the imperialist nature of U.S. capitalism, he declared
that U.S. capitalism "retains some of the characteristics of a <EM>young</EM>
capitalism" (Browder's italics) and that there is a "common interest" between
the proletariat and the big bourgeoisie in the U.S.A. Thus he pleaded for
the safeguarding of the system of monopolist trusts and dreamed about saving
U.S. capitalism from inevitable crises by means of class conciliation. Basing
himself on this absurd appraisal of U.S. capitalism and following a
capitulationist line of class collaboration with monopoly capital, Browder
in May 1944 presided over the dissolution of the Communist Party of the U.S.A.,
the party of the U.S. proletariat, and formed a non-Party organization, the
Communist Political Association of the U.S.A. From the very beginning, Browder's
wrong line met with opposition from many members of the Communist Party of
the U.S.A. with Comrade William Z. Poster at their head. Under the leadership
of Comrade Foster, the Communist Political Association in June 1945 passed
a resolution denouncing Browder's line. In July the association held a special
national convention and decided on the thorough liquidation of this line
and the re-establishment of the Communist Party of the U.S.A. Browder was
expelled from the Party in February 1946 because he persisted in his stand,
which was a betrayal of the proletariat, and because he openly supported
the imperialist policy of the Truman Administration and engaged in factional
activities against the Party.
