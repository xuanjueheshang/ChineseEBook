<P>
Comrades! You have been invited to this forum today to exchange ideas and
examine the relationship between work in the literary and artistic fields
and revolutionary work in general. Our aim is to ensure that revolutionary
literature and art follow the correct path of development and provide better
help to other revolutionary work in facilitating the overthrow of our national
enemy and the accomplishment of the task of national liberation.
<P>
In our struggle for the liberation of the Chinese people there are various
fronts, among which there are the fronts of the pen and of the gun, the cultural
and the military fronts. To defeat the enemy we must rely primarily on the
army with guns. But this army alone is not enough; we must also have a cultural
army, which is absolutely indispensable for uniting our own ranks and defeating
the enemy. Since the May 4th Movement such a cultural army has taken shape
in China, and it has helped the Chinese revolution, gradually reduced the
domain of China's feudal culture and of the comprador culture which serves
imperialist aggression, and weakened their influence. To oppose the new culture
the Chinese reactionaries can now only "pit quantity against quality". In
other words, reactionaries have money, and though they can produce nothing
good, they can go all out and produce in quantity. Literature and art have
been an important and successful part of the cultural front since the May
4th Movement. During the ten years' civil war, the revolutionary literature
and art movement grew greatly. That movement and the revolutionary war both
headed in the same general direction, but these two fraternal armies were
not linked together in their practical work because the reactionaries had
cut them off from each other. It is very good that since the outbreak of
the War of Resistance Against Japan, more and more revolutionary writers
and artists have been coming to Yenan and our other anti-Japanese base areas.
But it does not necessarily follow that, having come to the base areas, they
have already integrated themselves completely with the masses of the people
here. The two must be completely integrated if we are to push ahead with
our revolutionary work. The purpose of our meeting today is precisely to
ensure that literature and art fit well into the whole revolutionary machine
as a component part, that they operate as powerful weapons for uniting and
educating the people and for attacking and destroying the enemy, and that
they help the people fight the enemy with one heart and one mind. What are
the problems that must be solved to achieve this objective? I think they
are the problems of the class stand of the writers and artists, their attitude,
their audience, their work and their study.
<P>
The problem of class stand. Our stand is that of the proletariat and of the
masses. For members of the Communist Party, this means keeping to the stand
of the Party, keeping to Party spirit and Party policy. Are there any of
our literary and art workers who are still mistaken or not clear in their
understanding of this problem? I think there are. Many of our comrades have
frequently departed from the correct stand.
<P>
The problem of attitude. From one's stand there follow specific attitudes
towards specific matters. For instance, is one to extol or to expose? This
is a question of attitude. Which attitude is wanted? I would say both. The
question is, whom are you dealing with? There are three kinds of persons,
the enemy, our allies in the united front and our own people; the last are
the masses and their vanguard. We need to adopt a different attitude towards
each of the three. With regard to the enemy, that is, Japanese imperialism
and all the other enemies of the people, the task of revolutionary writers
and artists is to expose their duplicity and cruelty and at the same time
to point out the inevitability of their defeat, so as to encourage the
anti-Japanese army and people to fight staunchly with one heart and one mind
for their overthrow. With regard to our different allies in the united front,
our attitude should be one of both alliance and criticism, and there should
be different kinds of alliance and different kinds of criticism. We support
them in their resistance to Japan and praise them for any achievement. But
if they are not active in the War of Resistance, we should criticize them.
If anyone opposes the Communist Party and the people and keeps moving down
the path of reaction, we will firmly oppose him. As for the masses of the
people, their toil and their struggle, their army and their Party, we should
certainly praise them. The people, too, have their shortcomings. Among the
proletariat many retain petty-bourgeois ideas, while both the peasants and
the urban petty bourgeoisie have backward ideas; these are burdens hampering
them in their struggle. We should be patient and spend a long time in educating
them and helping them to get these loads off their backs and combat their
own shortcomings and errors, so that they can advance with great strides.
They have remoulded themselves in struggle or are doing so, and our literature
and art should depict this process. As long as they do not persist in their
errors, we should not dwell on their negative side and consequently make
the mistake of ridiculing them or, worse still, of being hostile to them.
Our writings should help them to unite, to make progress, to press ahead
with one heart and one mind, to discard what is backward and develop what
is revolutionary, and should certainly not do the opposite.
<P>
The problem of audience, i.e., the people for whom our works of literature
and art are produced. In the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and the
anti-Japanese base areas of northern and central China, this problem differs
from that in the Kuomintang areas, and differs still more from that in Shanghai
before the War of Resistance. In the Shanghai period, the audience for works
of revolutionary literature and art consisted mainly of a section of the
students, office workers and shop assistants. After the outbreak of the War
of Resistance the audience in the Kuomintang areas became somewhat wider,
but it still consisted mainly of the same kind of people because the government
there prevented the workers, peasants and soldiers from having access to
revolutionary literature and art. In our base areas the situation is entirely
different. Here the audience for works of literature and art consists of
workers, peasants, soldiers and revolutionary cadres. There are students
in the base areas, too, but they are different from students of the old type;
they are either former or future cadres. The cadres of all types, fighters
in the army, workers in the factories and peasants in the villages all want
to read books and newspapers once they become literate, and those who are
illiterate want to see plays and operas, look at drawings and paintings,
sing songs and hear music; they are the audience for our works of literature
and art. Take the cadres alone. Do not think they are few; they far outnumber
the readers of any book published in the Kuomintang areas. There, an edition
usually runs to only 2,000 copies, and even three editions add up to only
6,000; but as for the cadres in the base areas, in Yenan alone there are
more than 10,000 who read books. Many of them, moreover, are tempered
revolutionaries of long standing, who have come from all parts of the country
and will go out to work in different places, so it is very important to do
educational work among them. Our literary and art workers must do a good
job in this respect.
<P>
Since the audience for our literature and art consists of workers, peasants
and soldiers and of their cadres, the problem arises of understanding them
and knowing them well. A great deal of work has to be done in order to understand
them and know them well, to understand and know well all the different kinds
of people and phenomena in the Party and government organizations, in the
villages and factories and in the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies. Our
writers and artists have their literary and art work to do, but their primary
task is to understand people and know them well. In this regard, how have
matters stood with our writers and artists? I would say they have been lacking
in knowledge and understanding; they have been like "a hero with no place
to display his prowess". What does lacking in knowledge mean? Not knowing
people well. The writers and artists do not have a good knowledge either
of those whom they describe or of their audience; indeed they may hardly
know them at all. They do not know the workers or peasants or soldiers well,
and do not know the cadres well either. What does lacking in understanding
mean? Not understanding the language, that is, not being familiar with the
rich, lively language of the masses. Since many writers and artists stand
aloof from the masses and lead empty lives, naturally they are unfamiliar
with the language of the people. Accordingly, their works are not only insipid
in language but often contain nondescript expressions of their own coining
which run counter to popular usage. Many comrades like to talk about "a mass
style". But what does it really mean? It means that the thoughts and feelings
of our writers and artists should be fused with those of the masses of workers,
peasants and soldiers. To achieve this fusion, they should conscientiously
learn the language of the masses. How can you talk of literary and artistic
creation if you find the very language of the masses largely incomprehensible?
By "a hero with no place to display his prowess", we mean that your collection
of great truths is not appreciated by the masses. The more you put on the
airs of a veteran before the masses and play the "hero", the more you try
to peddle such stuff to the masses, the less likely they are to accept it.
If you want the masses to understand you, if you want to be one with the
masses, you must make up your mind to undergo a long and even painful process
of tempering. Here I might mention the experience of how my own feelings
changed. I began life as a student and at school acquired the ways of a student;
I then used to feel it undignified to do even a little manual labour, such
as carrying my own luggage in the presence of my fellow students, who were
incapable of carrying anything, either on their shoulders or in their hands.
At that time I felt that intellectuals were the only clean people in the
world, while in comparison workers and peasants were dirty. I did not mind
wearing the clothes of other intellectuals, believing them clean, but I would
not put on clothes belonging to a worker or peasant, believing them dirty.
But after I became a revolutionary and lived with workers and peasants and
with soldiers of the revolutionary army, I gradually came to know them well,
and they gradually came to know me well too. It was then, and only then,
that I fundamentally changed the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois feelings implanted
in me in the bourgeois schools. I came to feel that compared with the workers
and peasants the unremoulded intellectuals were not clean and that, in the
last analysis, the workers and peasants were the cleanest people and, even
though their hands were soiled and their feet smeared with cow-dung, they
were really cleaner than the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals.
That is what is meant by a change in feelings, a change from one class to
another. If our writers and artists who come from the intelligentsia want
their works to be well received by the masses, they must change and remould
their thinking and their feelings. Without such a change, without such
remoulding, they can do nothing well and will be misfits.
<P>
The last problem is study, by which I mean the study of Marxism-Leninism
and of society. Anyone who considers himself a revolutionary Marxist writer,
and especially any writer who is a member of the Communist Party, must have
a knowledge of Marxism-Leninism. At present, however, some comrades are lacking
in the basic concepts of Marxism. For instance, it is a basic Marxist concept
that being determines consciousness, that the objective realities of class
struggle and national struggle determine our thoughts and feelings. But some
of our comrades turn this upside down and maintain that everything ought
to start from "love". Now as for love, in a class society there can be only
class love; but these comrades are seeking a love transcending classes, love
in the abstract and also freedom in the abstract, truth in the abstract,
human nature in the abstract, etc. This shows that they have been very deeply
influenced by the bourgeoisie. They should thoroughly rid themselves of this
influence and modestly study Marxism-Leninism. It is right for writers and
artists to study literary and artistic creation, but the science of
Marxism-Leninism must be studied by all revolutionaries, writers and artists
not excepted. Writers and artists should study society, that is to say, should
study the various classes in society, their mutual relations and respective
conditions, their physiognomy and their psychology. Only when we grasp all
this clearly can we have a literature and art that is rich in content and
correct in orientation.
<P>
I am merely raising these problems today by way of introduction; I hope all
of you will express your views on these and other relevant problems.
<h4>
  <A NAME="p2">CONCLUSION</A>
</h4>
<P class="title">
<EM>May 23, 1942</EM>
<P>
Comrades! Our forum has had three meetings this month. In the pursuit of
truth we have carried on spirited debates in which scores of Party and non-Party
comrades have spoken, laying bare the issues and making them more concrete.
This, I believe, will<EM> </EM>very much benefit the whole literary and artistic
movement.
<P>
In discussing a problem, we should start from reality and not from definitions.
We would be following a wrong method if we first looked up definitions of
literature and art in textbooks and then used them to determine the guiding
principles for the present-day literary and artistic movement and to judge
the different opinions and controversies that arise today. We are Marxists,
and Marxism teaches that in our approach to a problem we should start from
objective facts, not from abstract definitions, and that we should derive
our guiding principles, policies and measures from an analysis of these facts.
We should do the same in our present discussion of literary and artistic
work.
<P>
What are the facts at present? The facts are: the War of Resistance Against
Japan which China has been fighting for five years; the world-wide anti-fascist
war; the vacillations of China's big landlord class and big bourgeoisie in
the War of Resistance and their policy of high-handed oppression of the people;
the revolutionary movement in literature and art since the May 4th Movement--its
great contributions to the revolution during the last twenty-three years
and its many shortcomings; the anti-Japanese democratic base areas of the
Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies and the integration of large numbers of
writers and artists with these armies and with the workers and peasants in
these areas; the difference in both environment and tasks between the writers
and artists in the base areas and those in the Kuomintang areas; and the
controversial issues concerning literature and art which have arisen in Yenan
and the other anti-Japanese base areas. These are the actual, undeniable
facts in the light of which we have to consider our problems.
<P>
What then is the crux of the matter? In my opinion, it consists fundamentally
of the problems of working for the masses and how to work for the masses.
Unless these two problems are solved, or solved properly, our writers and
artists will be ill-adapted to their environment and their tasks and will
come up against a series of difficulties from without and within. My concluding
remarks will centre on these two problems and also touch upon some related
ones.
<h4>
  I
</h4>
<P ALIGN=Left>
The first problem is: literature and art for whom?
<P>
This problem was solved long ago by Marxists, especially by Lenin. As far
back as 1905 Lenin pointed out emphatically that our literature and art should
"serve . . . the millions and tens of millions of working
people".<B>[<A HREF="#bm1">1</A>] </B>For comrades engaged in literary and
artistic work in the anti-Japanese base areas it might seem that this problem
is already solved and needs no further discussion. Actually, that is not
the case. Many comrades have not found a clear solution. Consequently their
sentiments, their works, their actions and their views on the guiding principles
for literature and art have inevitably been more or less at variance with
the needs of the masses and of the practical struggle. Of course, among the
numerous men of culture, writers, artists and other literary and artistic
workers engaged in the great struggle for liberation together with the Communist
Party and the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies, a few may be careerists
who are with us only temporarily, but the overwhelming majority are working
energetically for the common cause. By relying on these comrades, we have
achieved a great deal in our literature, drama, music and fine arts. Many
of these writers and artists have begun their work since the outbreak of
the War of Resistance; many others did much revolutionary work before the
war, endured many hardships and influenced broad masses of the people by
their activities and works. Why do we say, then, that even among these comrades
there are some who have not reached a clear solution of the problem of whom
literature and art are for? Is it conceivable that there are still some who
maintain that revolutionary literature and art are not for the masses of
the people but for the exploiters and oppressors?
<P>
Indeed literature and art exist which are for the exploiters and oppressors.
Literature and art for the landlord class are feudal literature and art.
Such were the literature and art of the ruling class in China's feudal era.
To this day such literature and art still have considerable influence in
China. Literature and art for the bourgeoisie are bourgeois literature and
art. People like Liang Shih-chiu, <B>[<A HREF="#bm2">2</A>] </B>whom Lu Hsun
criticized, talk about literature and art as transcending classes, but in
fact they uphold bourgeois literature and art and oppose proletarian literature
and art. Then literature and art exist which serve the imperialists--for
example, the works of Chou Tsojen, Chang Tzu-ping
<B>[<A HREF="#bm3">3</A>]</B> and their like--which we call traitor literature
and art. With us, literature and art are for the people, not for any of the
above groups. We have said that China's new culture at the present stage
is an anti-imperialist, anti-feudal culture of the masses of the people under
the leadership of the proletariat. Today, anything that is truly of the masses
must necessarily be led by the proletariat. Whatever is under the leadership
of the bourgeoisie cannot possibly be of the masses. Naturally, the same
applies to the new literature and art which are part of the new culture.
We should take over the rich legacy and the good traditions in literature
and art that have been handed down from past ages in China and foreign countries,
but the aim must still be to serve the masses of the people. Nor do we refuse
to utilize the literary and artistic forms of the past, but in our hands
these old forms, remoulded and infused with new content, also become something
revolutionary in the service of the people.
<P>
Who, then, are the masses of the people? The broadest sections of the people,
constituting more than 90 per cent of our total population, are the workers,
peasants, soldiers and urban petty bourgeoisie. Therefore, our literature
and art are first for the workers, the class that leads the revolution. Secondly,
they are for the peasants, the most numerous and most steadfast of our allies
in the revolution. Thirdly, they are for the armed workers and peasants,
namely, the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies and the other armed units
of the people, which are the main forces of the revolutionary war. Fourthly,
they are for the labouring masses of the urban petty bourgeoisie and for
the petty-bourgeois intellectuals, both of whom are also our allies in the
revolution and capable of long-term co-operation with us. These four kinds
of people constitute the overwhelming majority of the Chinese nation, the
broadest masses of the people.
<P>
Our literature and art should be for the four kinds of people we have enumerated.
To serve them, we must take the class stand of the proletariat and not that
of the petty bourgeoisie. Today, writers who cling to an individualist,
petty-bourgeois stand cannot truly serve the masses of revolutionary workers,
peasants and soldiers. Their interest is mainly focused on the small number
of petty-bourgeois intellectuals. This is the crucial reason why some of
our comrades cannot correctly solve the problem of "for whom?" In saying
this I am not referring to theory. In theory, or in words, no one in our
ranks regards the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers as less important
than the petty-bourgeois intellectuals. I am referring to practice, to action.
In practice, in action, do they regard petty-bourgeois intellectuals as more
important than workers, peasants and soldiers? I think they do. Many comrades
concern themselves with studying the petty-bourgeois intellectuals and analysing
their psychology, and they concentrate on portraying these intellectuals
and excusing or defending their shortcomings, instead of guiding the
intellectuals to join with them in getting closer to the masses of workers,
peasants and soldiers, taking part in the practical struggles of the masses,
portraying and educating the masses. Coming from the petty bourgeoisie and
being themselves intellectuals, many comrades seek friends only among
intellectuals and concentrate on studying and describing them. Such study
and description are proper if done from a proletarian position. But that
is not what they do, or not what they do fully. They take the petty-bourgeois
stand and produce works that are the self-expression of the petty bourgeoisie,
as can be seen in quite a number of literary and artistic products. Often
they show heartfelt sympathy for intellectuals of petty-bourgeois origin,
to the extent of sympathizing with or even praising their shortcomings. On
the other hand, these comrades seldom come into contact with the masses of
workers, peasants and soldiers, do not understand or study them, do not have
intimate friends among them and are not good at portraying them; when they
do depict them, the clothes are the clothes of working people but the faces
are those of petty-bourgeois intellectuals. In certain respects they are
fond of the workers, peasants and soldiers and the cadres stemming from them;
but there are times when they do not like them and there are some respects
in which they do not like them: they do not like their feelings or their
manner or their nascent literature and art (the wall newspapers, murals,
folk songs, folk tales, etc.). At times they are fond of these things too,
but that is when they are hunting for novelty, for something with which to
embellish their own works, or even for certain backward features. At other
times they openly despise these things and are partial to what belongs to
the petty-bourgeois intellectuals or even to the bourgeoisie. These comrades
have their feet planted on the side of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals;
or, to put it more elegantly, their innermost soul is still a kingdom of
the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia. Thus they have not yet solved, or not
yet clearly solved, the problem of "for whom?" This applies not only to newcomers
to Yenan; even among comrades who have been to the front and worked for a
number of years in our base areas and in the Eighth Route and New Fourth
Armies, many have not completely solved this problem. It requires a long
period of time, at least eight or ten years, to solve it thoroughly. But
however long it takes, solve it we must and solve it unequivocally and
thoroughly. Our literary and art workers must accomplish this task and shift
their stand; they must gradually move their feet over to the side of the
workers, peasants and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat, through the
process of going into their very midst and into the thick of practical struggles
and through the process of studying Marxism and society. Only in this way
can we have a literature and art that are truly for the workers, peasants
and soldiers, a truly proletarian literature and art.
<P>
This question of "for whom?" is fundamental; it is a question of principle.
The controversies and divergences, the opposition and disunity arising among
some comrades in the past were not on this fundamental question of principle
but on secondary questions, or even on issues involving no principle. On
this question of principle, however, there has been hardly any divergence
between the two contending sides and they have shown almost complete agreement;
to some extent, both tend to look down upon the workers, peasants and soldiers
and divorce themselves from the masses. I say "to some extent" because, generally
speaking, these comrades do not look down upon the workers, peasants and
soldiers or divorce themselves from the masses in the same way as the Kuomintang
does. Nevertheless, the tendency is there. Unless this fundamental problem
is solved, many other problems will not be easy to solve. Take, for instance,
the sectarianism in literary and art circles. This too is a question of
principle, but sectarianism can only be eradicated by putting forward and
faithfully applying the slogans, "For the workers and peasants!", "For the
Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies!" and "Go among the masses!" Otherwise
the problem of sectarianism can never be solved. Lu Hsun once said:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  A common aim is the prerequisite for a united front.... The fact that our
  front is not united shows that we have not been able to unify our aims, and
  that some people are working only for small groups or indeed only for themselves.
  If we all aim at serving the masses of workers and peasants, our front will
  of course be united.<B>[<A HREF="#bm4">4</A>]</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The problem existed then in Shanghai; now it exists in Chungking too. In
such places the problem can hardly be solved thoroughly, because the rulers
oppress the revolutionary writers and artists and deny them the freedom to
go out among the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers. Here with us the
situation is entirely different. We encourage revolutionary writers and artists
to be active in forming intimate contacts with the workers, peasants and
soldiers, giving them complete freedom to go among the masses and to create
a genuinely revolutionary literature and art. Therefore, here among us the
problem is nearing solution. But nearing solution is not the same as a complete
and thorough solution. We must study Marxism and study society, as we have
been saying, precisely in order to achieve a complete and thorough solution.
By Marxism we mean living Marxism which plays an effective role in the life
and struggle of the masses, not Marxism in words. With Marxism in words
transformed into Marxism in real life, there will be no more sectarianism.
Not only will the problem of sectarianism be solved, but many other problems
as well.
<h4>
  II
</h4>
<P>
Having settled the problem of whom to serve, we come to the next problem,
how to serve. To put it in the words of some of our comrades: should we devote
ourselves to raising standards, or should we devote ourselves to popularization?
<P>
In the past, some comrades, to a certain or even a serious extent, belittled
and neglected popularization and laid undue stress on raising standards.
Stress should be laid on raising standards, but to do so one-sidedly and
exclusively, to do so excessively, is a mistake. The lack of a clear solution
to the problem of "for whom?", which I referred to earlier, also manifests
itself in this connection. As these comrades are not clear on the problem
of "for whom?", they have no correct criteria for the "raising of standards"
and the "popularization" they speak of, and are naturally still less able
to find the correct relationship between the two. Since our literature and
art are basically for the workers, peasants and soldiers, "popularization"
means to popularize among the workers, peasants and soldiers, and "raising
standards" means to advance from their present level. What should we popularize
among them? Popularize what is needed and can be readily accepted by the
feudal landlord class? Popularize what is needed and can be readily accepted
by the bourgeoisie? Popularize what is needed and can be readily accepted
by the petty-bourgeois intellectuals? No, none of these will do. We must
popularize only what is needed and can be readily accepted by the workers,
peasants and soldiers themselves. Consequently, prior to the task of educating
the workers, peasants and soldiers, there is the task of learning from them.
This is even more true of raising standards. There must be a basis from which
to raise. Take a bucket of water, for instance; where is it to be raised
from if not from the ground? From mid-air? From what basis, then, are literature
and art to be raised? From the basis of the feudal classes? From the basis
of the bourgeoisie? From the basis of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals?
No, not from any of these; only from the basis of the masses of workers,
peasants and soldiers. Nor does this mean raising the workers, peasants and
soldiers to the "heights" of the feudal classes, the bourgeoisie or the
petty-bourgeois intellectuals; it means raising the level of literature and
art in the direction in which the workers, peasants and soldiers are themselves
advancing, in the direction in which the proletariat is advancing. Here again
the task of learning from the workers, peasants and soldiers comes in. Only
by starting from the workers, peasants and soldiers can we have a correct
understanding of popularization and of the raising of standards and find
the proper relationship between the two.
<P>
In the last analysis, what is the source of all literature and art? Works
of literature and art, as ideological forms, are products of the reflection
in the human brain of the life of a given society. Revolutionary literature
and art are the products of the reflection of the life of the people in the
brains of revolutionary writers and artists. The life of the people is always
a mine of the raw materials for literature and art, materials in their natural
form, materials that are crude, but most vital, rich and fundamental; they
make all literature and art seem pallid by comparison; they provide literature
and art with an inexhaustible source, their only source. They are the only
source, for there can be no other. Some may ask, is there not another source
in books, in the literature and art of ancient times and of foreign countries?
In fact, the literary and artistic works of the past are not a source but
a stream; they were created by our predecessors and the foreigners out of
the literary and artistic raw materials they found in the life of the people
of their time and place. We must take over all the fine things in our literary
and artistic heritage, critically assimilate whatever is beneficial, and
use them as examples when we create works out of the literary and artistic
raw materials in the life of the people of our own time and place. It makes
a difference whether or not we have such examples, the difference between
crudeness and refinement, between roughness and polish, between a low and
a high level, and between slower and faster work. Therefore, we must on no
account reject the legacies of the ancients and the foreigners or refuse
to learn from them, even though they are the works of the feudal or bourgeois
classes. But taking over legacies and using them as examples must never replace
our own creative work; nothing can do that. Uncritical transplantation or
copying from the ancients and the foreigners is the most sterile and harmful
dogmatism in literature and art. China's revolutionary writers and artists,
writers and artists of promise, must go among the masses; they must for a
long period of time unreservedly and whole-heartedly go among the masses
of workers, peasants and soldiers, go into the heat of the struggle, go to
the only source, the broadest and richest source, in order to observe,
experience, study and analyse all the different kinds of people, all the
classes, all the masses, all the vivid patterns of life and struggle, all
the raw materials of literature and art. Only then can they proceed to creative
work. Otherwise, you will have nothing to work with and you will be nothing
but a phoney writer or artist, the kind that Lu Hsun in his will so earnestly
cautioned his son never to become.<B>[<A HREF="#bm5">5</A>]</B>
<P>
Although man's social life is the only source of literature and art and is
incomparably livelier and richer in content, the people are not satisfied
with life alone and demand literature and art as well. Why? Because, while
both are beautiful, life as reflected in works of literature and art can
and ought to be on a higher plane, more intense, more concentrated, more
typical, nearer the ideal, and therefore more universal than actual everyday
life. Revolutionary literature and art should create a variety of characters
out of real life and help the masses to propel history forward. For example,
there is suffering from hunger, cold and oppression on the one hand, and
exploitation and oppression of man by man on the other. These facts exist
everywhere and people look upon them as commonplace. Writers and artists
concentrate such everyday phenomena, typify the contradictions and struggles
within them and produce works which awaken the masses, fire them with enthusiasm
and impel them to unite and struggle to transform their environment. Without
such literature and art, this task could not be fulfilled, or at least not
so effectively and speedily.
<P>
What is meant by popularizing and by raising standards in works of literature
and art? What is the relationship between these two tasks? Popular works
are simpler and plainer, and therefore more readily accepted by the broad
masses of the people today. Works of a higher quality, being more polished,
are more difficult to produce and in general do not circulate so easily and
quickly among the masses at present. The problem facing the workers, peasants
and soldiers is this: they are now engaged in a bitter and bloody struggle
with the enemy but are illiterate and uneducated as a result of long years
of rule by the feudal and bourgeois classes, and therefore they are eagerly
demanding enlightenment, education and works of literature and art which
meet their urgent needs and which are easy to absorb, in order to heighten
their enthusiasm in struggle and confidence in victory, strengthen their
unity and fight the enemy with one heart and one mind. For them the prime
need is not "more flowers on the brocade" but "fuel in snowy weather". In
present conditions, therefore, popularization is the more pressing task.
It is wrong to belittle or neglect popularization.
<P>
Nevertheless, no hard and fast line can be drawn between popularization and
the raising of standards. Not only is it possible to popularize some works
of higher quality even now, but the cultural level of the broad masses is
steadily rising. If popularization remains at the same level for ever, with
the same stuff being supplied month after month and year after year, always
the same "Little Cowherd" <B>[<A HREF="#bm6">6</A>]</B> and the same "man,
hand, mouth, knife, cow, goat", <B>[<A HREF="#bm7">7</A>]</B> will not the
educators and those being educated be six of one and half a dozen of the
other? What would be the sense of such popularization? The people demand
popularization and, following that, higher standards; they demand higher
standards month by month and year by year. Here popularization means popularizing
for the people and raising of standards means raising the level for the people.
And such raising is not from mid-air, or behind closed doors, but is actually
based on popularization. It is determined by and at the same time guides
popularization. In China as a whole the development of the revolution and
of revolutionary culture is uneven and their spread is gradual. While in
one place there is popularization and then raising of standards on the basis
of popularization, in other places popularization has not even begun. Hence
good experience in popularization leading to higher standards in one locality
can be applied in other localities and serve to guide popularization and
the raising of standards there, saving many twists and turns along the road.
Internationally, the good experience of foreign countries, and especially
Soviet experience, can also serve to guide us. With us, therefore, the raising
of standards is based on popularization, while popularization is guided by
the raising of standards. Precisely for this reason, so far from being an
obstacle to the raising of standards, the work of popularization we are speaking
of supplies the basis for the work of raising standards which we are now
doing on a limited scale, and prepares the necessary conditions for us to
raise standards in the future on a much broader scale.
<P>
Besides such raising of standards as meets the needs of the masses directly,
there is the kind which meets their needs indirectly, that is, the kind which
is needed by the cadres. The cadres are the advanced elements of the masses
and generally have received more education; literature and art of a higher
level are entirely necessary for them. To ignore this would be a mistake.
Whatever is done for the cadres is also entirely for the masses, because
it is only through the cadres that we can educate and guide the masses. If
we go against this aim, if what we give the cadres cannot help them educate
and guide the masses, our work of raising standards will be like shooting
at random and will depart from the fundamental principle of serving the masses
of the people.
<P>
To sum up: through the creative labour of revolutionary writers and artists,
the raw materials found in the life of the people are shaped into the ideological
form of literature and art serving the masses of the people. Included here
are the more advanced literature and art as developed on the basis of elementary
literature and art and as required by those sections of the masses whose
level has been raised, or, more immediately, by the cadres among the masses.
Also included here are elementary literature and art which, conversely, are
guided by more advanced literature and art and are needed primarily by the
overwhelming majority of the masses at present. Whether more advanced or
elementary, all our literature and art are for the masses of the people,
and in the first place for the workers, peasants and soldiers; they are created
for the workers, peasants and soldiers and are for their use.
<P>
Now that we have settled the problem of the relationship between the raising
of standards and popularization, that of the relationship between the specialists
and the popularizers can also be settled. Our specialists are not only for
the cadres, but also, and indeed chiefly, for the masses. Our specialists
in literature should pay attention to the wall newspapers of the masses and
to the reportage written in the army and the villages. Our specialists in
drama should pay attention to the small troupes in the army and the villages.
Our specialists in music should pay attention to the songs of the masses.
Our specialists in the fine arts should pay attention to the fine arts of
the masses. All these comrades should make close contact with comrades engaged
in the work of popularizing literature and art among the masses. On the one
hand, they should help and guide the popularizers, and on the other, they
should learn from these comrades and, through them, draw nourishment from
the masses to replenish and enrich themselves so that their specialities
do not become "ivory towers", detached from the masses and from reality and
devoid of content or life. We should esteem the specialists, for they are
very valuable to our cause. But we should tell them that no revolutionary
writer or artist can do any meaningful work unless he is closely linked with
the masses, gives expression to their thoughts and feelings and serves them
as a loyal spokesman. Only by speaking for the masses can he educate them
and only by being their pupil can he be their teacher. If he regards himself
as their master, as an aristocrat who lords it over the "lower orders", then,
no matter how talented he may be, he will not be needed by the masses and
his work will have no future.
<P>
Is this attitude of ours utilitarian? Materialists do not oppose utilitarianism
in general but the utilitarianism of the feudal, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois
classes; they oppose those hypocrites who attack utilitarianism in words
but in deeds embrace the most selfish and short-sighted utilitarianism. There
is no "ism" in the world that transcends utilitarian considerations; in class
society there can be only the utilitarianism of this or that class. We are
proletarian revolutionary utilitarians and take as our point of departure
the unity of the present and future interests of the broadest masses, who
constitute over 90 per cent of the population; hence we are revolutionary
utilitarians aiming for the broadest and the most long-range objectives,
not narrow utilitarians concerned only with the partial and the immediate.
If, for instance, you reproach the masses for their utilitarianism and yet
for your own utility, or that of a narrow clique, force on the market and
propagandize among the masses a work which pleases only the few but is useless
or even harmful to the majority, then you are not only insulting the masses
but also revealing your own lack of self-knowledge. A thing is good only
when it brings real benefit to the masses of the people. Your work may be
as good as "The Spring Snow", but if for the time being it caters only to
the few and the masses are still singing the "Song of the Rustic Poor",
<B>[<A HREF="#bm8">8</A>]</B> you will get nowhere by simply scolding them
instead of trying to raise their level. The question now is to bring about
a unity between "The Spring Snow" and the "Song of the Rustic Poor", between
higher standards and popularization. Without such a unity, the highest art
of any expert cannot help being utilitarian in the narrowest sense; you may
call this art "pure and lofty" but that is merely your own name for it which
the masses will not endorse.
<P>
Once we have solved the problems of fundamental policy, of serving the workers,
peasants and soldiers and of how to serve them, such other problems as whether
to write about the bright or the dark side of life and the problem of unity
will also be solved. If everyone agrees on the fundamental policy, it should
be adhered to by all our workers, all our schools, publications and organizations
in the field of literature and art and in all our literary and artistic
activities. It is wrong to depart from this policy and anything at variance
with it must be duly corrected.
<h4>

<P>
Since our literature and art are for the masses of the people, we can proceed
to discuss a problem of inner-Party relations, <EM>i.e., </EM>the relation
between the Party's work in literature and art and the Party's work as a
whole, and in addition a problem of the Party's external relations, <EM>i.e.,
</EM>the relation between the Party's work in literature and art and the
work of non-Party people in this field, a problem of the united front in
literary and art circles.
<P>
Let us consider the first problem. In the world today all culture, all literature
and art belong to definite classes and are geared to definite political lines.
There is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake, art that stands above
classes or art that is detached from or independent of politics. Proletarian
literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause;
they are, as Lenin said, cogs and wheels <B>[<A HREF="#bm9">9</A>]</B> in
the whole revolutionary machine. Therefore, Party work in literature and
art occupies a definite and assigned position in Party revolutionary work
as a whole and is subordinated to the revolutionary tasks set by the Party
in a given revolutionary period. Opposition to this arrangement is certain
to lead to dualism or pluralism, and in essence amounts to "politics--Marxist,
art--bourgeois", as with Trotsky. We do not favour overstressing the importance
of literature and art, but neither do we favour underestimating their importance.
Literature and art are subordinate to politics, but in their turn exert a
great influence on politics. Revolutionary literature and art are part of
the whole revolutionary cause, they are cogs and wheels in it, and though
in comparison with certain other and more important parts they may be less
significant and less urgent and may occupy a secondary position, nevertheless,
they are indispensable cogs and wheels in the whole machine, an indispensable
part of the entire revolutionary cause. If we had no literature and art even
in the broadest and most ordinary sense, we could not carry on the revolutionary
movement and win victory. Failure to recognize this is wrong. Furthermore,
when we say that literature and art are subordinate to politics, we mean
class politics, the politics of the masses, not the politics of a few so-called
statesmen. Politics, whether revolutionary or counter-revolutionary, is the
struggle of class against class, not the activity of a few individuals. The
revolutionary struggle on the ideological and artistic fronts must be subordinate
to the political struggle because only through politics can the needs of
the class and the masses find expression in concentrated form. Revolutionary
statesmen, the political specialists who know the science or art of revolutionary
politics, are simply the leaders of millions upon millions of statesmen--the
masses. Their task is to collect the opinions of these mass statesmen, sift
and refine them, and return them to the masses, who then take them and put
them into practice. They are therefore not the kind of aristocratic "statesmen"
who work behind closed doors and fancy they have a monopoly of wisdom. Herein
lies the difference in principle between proletarian statesmen and decadent
bourgeois statesmen. This is precisely why there can be complete unity between
the political character of our literary and artistic works and their
truthfulness. It would be wrong to fail to realize this and to debase the
politics and the statesmen of the proletariat.
<P>
Let us consider next the question of the united front in the world of literature
and art. Since literature and art are subordinate to politics and since the
fundamental problem in China's politics today is resistance to Japan, our
Party writers and artists must in the first place unite on this issue of
resistance to Japan with all non-Party writers and artists (ranging from
Party sympathizers and petty-bourgeois writers and artists to all those writers
and artists of the bourgeois and landlord classes who are in favour of resistance
to Japan). Secondly, we should unite with them on the issue of democracy.
On this issue there is a section of anti-Japanese writers and artists who
do not agree with us, so the range of unity will unavoidably be somewhat
more limited. Thirdly, we should unite with them on issues peculiar to the
literary and artistic world, questions of method and style in literature
and art; here again, as we are for socialist realism and some people do not
agree, the range of unity will be narrower still. While on one issue there
is unity, on another there is struggle, there is criticism. The issues are
at once separate and interrelated, so that even on the very ones which give
rise to unity, such as resistance to Japan, there are at the same time struggle
and criticism. In a united front, "all unity and no struggle" and "all struggle
and no unity" are both wrong policies--as with the Right capitulationism
and tailism, or the "Left" exclusivism and sectarianism, practiced by some
comrades in the past. This is as true in literature and art as in politics.
<P>
The petty-bourgeois writers and artists constitute an important force among
the forces of the united front in literary and art circles in China. There
are many shortcomings in both their thinking and their works, but, comparatively
speaking, they are inclined towards the revolution and are close to the working
people. Therefore, it is an especially important task to help them overcome
their shortcomings and to win them over to the front which serves the working
people.

<P>
Literary and art criticism is one of the principal methods of struggle in
the world of literature and art. It should be developed and, as comrades
have rightly pointed out, our past work in this respect has been quite
inadequate. Literary and art criticism is a complex question which requires
a great deal of special study. Here I shall concentrate only on the basic
problem of criteria in criticism. I shall also comment briefly on a few specific
problems raised by some comrades and on certain incorrect views.
<P>
In literary and art criticism there are two criteria, the political and the
artistic. According to the political criterion, everything is good that is
helpful to unity and resistance to Japan, that encourages the masses to be
of one heart and one mind, that opposes retrogression and promotes progress;
on the other hand, everything is bad that is detrimental to unity and resistance
to Japan, foments dissension and discord among the masses and opposes progress
and drags people back. How can we tell the good from the bad--by the motive
(the subjective intention) or by the effect (social practice)? Idealists
stress motive and ignore effect, while mechanical materialists stress effect
and ignore motive. In contradistinction to both, we dialectical materialists
insist on the unity of motive and effect. The motive of serving the masses
is inseparably linked with the effect of winning their approval; the two
must be united. The motive of serving the individual or a small clique is
not good, nor is it good to have the motive of serving the masses without
the effect of winning their approval and benefiting them. In examining the
subjective intention of a writer or artist, that is, whether his motive is
correct and good, we do not judge by his declarations but by the effect of
his actions (mainly his works) on the masses in society. The criterion for
judging subjective intention or motive is social practice and its effect.
We want no sectarianism in our literary and art criticism and, subject to
the general principle of unity for resistance to Japan, we should tolerate
literary and art works with a variety of political attitudes. But at the
same time, in our criticism we must adhere firmly to principle and severely
criticize and repudiate all works of literature and art expressing views
in opposition to the nation, to science, to the masses and to the Communist
Party, because these so-called works of literature and art proceed from the
motive and produce the effect of undermining unity for resistance to Japan.
According to the artistic criterion, all works of a higher artistic quality
are good or comparatively good, while those of a lower artistic quality are
bad or comparatively bad. Here, too, of course, social effect must be taken
into account. There is hardly a writer or artist who does not consider his
own work beautiful, and our criticism ought to permit the free competition
of all varieties of works of art; but it is also entirely necessary to subject
these works to correct criticism according to the criteria of the science
of aesthetics, so that art of a lower level can be gradually raised to a
higher and art which does not meet the demands of the struggle of the broad
masses can be transformed into art that does.
<P>
There is the political criterion and there is the artistic criterion; what
is the relationship between the two? Politics cannot be equated with art,
nor can a general world outlook be equated with a method of artistic creation
and criticism. We deny not only that there is an abstract and absolutely
unchangeable political criterion, but also that there is an abstract and
absolutely unchangeable artistic criterion; each class in every class society
has its own political and artistic criteria. But all classes in all class
societies invariably put the political criterion first and the artistic criterion
second. The bourgeoisie always shuts out proletarian literature and art,
however great their artistic merit. The proletariat must similarly distinguish
among the literary and art works of past ages and determine its attitude
towards them only after examining their attitude to the people and whether
or not they had any progressive significance historically. Some works which
politically are downright reactionary may have a certain artistic quality.
The more reactionary their content and the higher their artistic quality,
the more poisonous they are to the people, and the more necessary it is to
reject them. A common characteristic of the literature and art of all exploiting
classes in their period of decline is the contradiction between their reactionary
political content and their artistic form. What we demand is the unity of
politics and art, the unity of content and form, the unity of revolutionary
political content and the highest possible perfection of artistic form. Works
of art which lack artistic quality have no force, however progressive they
are politically. Therefore, we oppose both the tendency to produce works
of art with a wrong political viewpoint and the tendency towards the "poster
and slogan style" which is correct in political viewpoint but lacking in
artistic power. On questions of literature and art we must carry on a struggle
on two fronts.
<P>
Both these tendencies can be found in the thinking of many comrades. A good
number of comrades tend to neglect artistic technique; it is therefore necessary
to give attention to the raising of artistic standards. But as I see it,
the political side is more of a problem at present. Some comrades lack elementary
political knowledge and consequently have all sorts of muddled ideas. Let
me cite a few examples from Yenan.
<P>
"The theory of human nature." Is there such a thing as human nature? Of course
there is. But there is only human nature in the concrete, no human nature
in the abstract. In class society there is only human nature of a class
character; there is no human nature above classes. We uphold the human nature
of the proletariat and of the masses of the people, while the landlord and
bourgeois classes uphold the human nature of their own classes, only they
do not say so but make it out to be the only human nature in existence. The
human nature boosted by certain petty-bourgeois intellectuals is also divorced
from or opposed to the masses; what they call human nature is in essence
nothing but bourgeois individualism, and so, in their eyes, proletarian human
nature is contrary to human nature. "The theory of human nature" which some
people in Yenan advocate as the basis of their so-called theory of literature
and art puts the matter in just this way and is wholly wrong.
<P>
"The fundamental point of departure for literature and art is love, love
of humanity." Now love may serve as a point of departure, but there is a
more basic one. Love as an idea is a product of objective practice.
Fundamentally, we do not start from ideas but from objective practice. Our
writers and artists who come from the ranks of the intellectuals love the
proletariat because society has made them feel that they and the proletariat
share a common fate. We hate Japanese imperialism because Japanese imperialism
oppresses us. There is absolutely no such thing in the world as love or hatred
with out reason or cause. As for the so-called love of humanity, there has
been no such all-inclusive love since humanity was divided into classes.
All the ruling classes of the past were fond of advocating it, and so were
many so-called sages and wise men, but nobody has ever really practiced it,
because it is impossible in class society. There will be genuine love of
humanity--after classes are eliminated all over the world. Classes have split
society into many antagonistic groupings; there will be love of all humanity
when classes are eliminated, but not now. We cannot love enemies, we cannot
love social evils, our aim is to destroy them. This is common sense; can
it be that some of our writers and artists still do not understand this?
<P>
"Literary and artistic works have always laid equal stress on the bright
and the dark, half and half." This statement contains many muddled ideas.
It is not true that literature and art have always done this. Many
petty-bourgeois writers have never discovered the bright side. Their works
only expose the dark and are known as the "literature of exposure". Some
of their works simply specialize in preaching pessimism and world-weariness.
On the other hand, Soviet literature in the period of socialist construction
portrays mainly the bright. It, too, describes shortcomings in work and portrays
negative characters, but this only serves as a contrast to bring out the
brightness of the whole picture and is not on a so-called half-and-half basis.
The writers and artists of the bourgeoisie in its period of reaction depict
the revolutionary masses as mobs and themselves as saints, thus reversing
the bright and the dark. Only truly revolutionary writers and artists can
correctly solve the problem of whether to extol or to expose. All the dark
forces harming the masses of the people must be exposed and all the revolutionary
struggles of the masses of the people must be extolled; this is the fundamental
task of revolutionary writers and artists.
<P>
"The task of literature and art has always been to expose." This assertion,
like the previous one, arises from ignorance of the science of history.
Literature and art, as we have shown, have never been devoted solely to exposure.
For revolutionary writers and artists the targets for exposure can never
be the masses, but only the aggressors, exploiters and oppressors and the
evil influence they have on the people. The masses too have shortcomings,
which should be overcome by criticism and self-criticism within the people's
own ranks, and such criticism and self-criticism is also one of the most
important tasks of literature and art. But this should not be regarded as
any sort of "exposure of the people". As for the people, the question is
basically one of education and of raising their level. Only counter-revolutionary
writers and artists describe the people as "born fools" and the revolutionary
masses as "tyrannical mobs".
<P>
"This is still the period of the satirical essay, and Lu Hsun's style of
writing is still needed." Living under the rule of the dark forces and deprived
of freedom of speech, Lu Hsun used burning satire and freezing irony, cast
in the form of essays, to do battle; and he was entirely right. We, too,
must hold up to sharp ridicule the fascists, the Chinese reactionaries and
everything that harms the people; but in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border
Region and the anti-Japanese base areas behind the enemy lines, where democracy
and freedom are granted in full to the revolutionary writers and artists
and withheld only from the counter-revolutionaries, the style of the essay
should not simply be like Lu Hsun's. Here we can shout at the top of our
voices and have no need for veiled and roundabout expressions, which are
hard for the people to understand. When dealing with the people and not with
their enemies, Lu Hsun never ridiculed or attacked the revolutionary people
and the revolutionary Party in his "satirical essay period", and these essays
were entirely different in manner from those directed against the enemy.
To criticize the people's shortcomings is necessary, as we have already said,
but in doing so we must truly take the stand of the people and speak out
of whole-hearted eagerness to protect and educate them. To treat comrades
like enemies is to go over to the stand of the enemy. Are we then to abolish
satire? No. Satire is always necessary. But there are several kinds of satire,
each with a different attitude, satire to deal with our enemies, satire to
deal with our allies and satire to deal with our own ranks. We are not opposed
to satire in general; what we must abolish is the abuse of satire.
<P>
"I am not given to praise and eulogy. The works of people who eulogize what
is bright are not necessarily great and the works of those who depict the
dark are not necessarily paltry." If you are a bourgeois writer or artist,
you will eulogize not the proletariat but the bourgeoisie, and if you are
a proletarian writer or artist, you will eulogize not the bourgeoisie but
the proletariat and working people: it must be one or the other. The works
of the eulogists of the bourgeoisie are not necessarily great, nor are the
works of those who show that the bourgeoisie is dark necessarily paltry;
the works of the eulogists of the proletariat are not necessarily not great,
but the works of those who depict the so-called "darkness" of the proletariat
are bound to be paltry--are these not facts of history as regards literature
and art? Why should we not eulogize the people, the creators of the history
of mankind? Why should we not eulogize the proletariat, the Communist Party,
New Democracy and socialism? There is a type of person who has no enthusiasm
for the people's cause and looks coldly from the side-lines at the struggles
and victories of the proletariat and its vanguard; what he is interested
in, and will never weary of eulogizing, is himself, plus perhaps a few figures
in his small coterie. Of course, such petty-bourgeois individualists are
unwilling to eulogize the deeds and virtues of the revolutionary people or
heighten their courage in struggle and their confidence in victory. Persons
of this type are merely termites in the revolutionary ranks; of course, the
revolutionary people have no need for these "singers".
<P>
"It is not a question of stand; my class stand is correct, my intentions
are good and I understand all right, but I am not good at expressing myself
and so the effect turns out bad." I have already spoken about the dialectical
materialist view of motive and effect. Now I want to ask, is not the question
of effect one of stand? A person who acts solely by motive and does not inquire
what effect his action will have is like a doctor who merely writes prescriptions
but does not care how many patients die of them. Or take a political party
which merely makes declarations but does not care whether they are carried
out. It may well be asked, is this a correct stand? And is the intention
here good? Of course, mistakes may occur even though the effect has been
taken into account beforehand, but is the intention good when one continues
in the same old rut after facts have proved that the effect is bad? In judging
a party or a doctor, we must look at practice, at the effect. The same applies
in judging a writer. A person with truly good intentions must take the effect
into account, sum up experience and study the methods or, in creative work,
study the technique of expression. A person with truly good intentions must
criticize the shortcomings and mistakes in his own work with the utmost candour
and resolve to correct them. This is precisely why Communists employ the
method of self-criticism. This alone is the correct stand. Only in this process
of serious and responsible practice is it possible gradually to understand
what the correct stand is and gradually obtain a good grasp of it. If one
does not move in this direction in practice, if there is simply the complacent
assertion that one "understands all right", then in fact one has not understood
at all.
<P>
"To call on us to study Marxism is to repeat the mistake of the dialectical
materialist creative method, which will harm the creative mood." To study
Marxism means to apply the dialectical materialist and historical materialist
viewpoint in our observation of the world, of society and of literature and
art; it does not mean writing philosophical lectures into our works of literature
and art. Marxism embraces but cannot replace realism in literary and artistic
creation, just as it embraces but cannot replace the atomic and electronic
theories in physics. Empty, dry dogmatic formulas do indeed destroy the creative
mood; not only that, they first destroy Marxism. Dogmatic "Marxism" is not
Marxism, it is anti-Marxism. Then does not Marxism destroy the creative mood?
Yes, it does. It definitely destroys creative moods that are feudal, bourgeois,
petty-bourgeois, liberalistic, individualist, nihilist, art-for-art's sake,
aristocratic, decadent or pessimistic, and every other creative mood that
is alien to the masses of the people and to the proletariat. So far as
proletarian writers and artists are concerned, should not these kinds of
creative moods be destroyed? I think they should; they should be utterly
destroyed. And while they are being destroyed, something new can be constructed.

<P>
The problems discussed here exist in our literary and art circles in Yenan.
What does that show? It shows that wrong styles of work still exist to a
serious extent in our literary and art circles and that there are still many
defects among our comrades, such as idealism, dogmatism, empty illusions,
empty talk, contempt for practice and aloofness from the masses, all of which
call for an effective and serious campaign of rectification.
<P>
We have many comrades who are still not very clear on the difference between
the proletariat and the petty bourgeoisie. There are many Party members who
have joined the Communist Party organizationally but have not yet joined
the Party wholly or at all ideologically. Those who have not joined the Party
ideologically still carry a great deal of the muck of the exploiting classes
in their heads, and have no idea at all of what proletarian ideology, or
communism, or the Party is. "Proletarian ideology?" they think. "The same
old stuff!" Little do they know that it is no easy matter to acquire this
stuff. Some will never have the slightest Communist flavour about them as
long as they live and can only end up by leaving the Party.
<P>
Therefore, though the majority in our Party and in our ranks are clean and
honest, we must in all seriousness put things in order both ideologically
and organizationally if we are to develop the revolutionary movement more
effectively and bring it to speedier success. To put things in order
organizationally requires our first doing so ideologically, our launching
a struggle of proletarian ideology against non-proletarian ideology. An
ideological struggle is already under way in literary and art circles in
Yenan, and it is most necessary. Intellectuals of petty-bourgeois origin
always stubbornly try in all sorts of ways, including literary and artistic
ways, to project themselves and spread their views, and they want the Party
and the world to be remoulded in their own image. In the circumstances it
is our duty to jolt these "comrades" and tell them sharply, "That won't work!
The proletariat cannot accommodate itself to you; to yield to you would actually
be to yield to the big landlord class and the big bourgeoisie and to run
the risk of undermining our Party and our country." Whom then must we yield
to? We can mould the Party and the world only in the image of the proletarian
vanguard. We hope our comrades in literary and art circles will realize the
seriousness of this great debate and join actively in this struggle, so that
every comrade may become sound and our entire ranks may become truly united
and consolidated ideologically and organizationally.
<P>
Because of confusion in their thinking, many of our comrades are not quite
able to draw a real distinction between our revolutionary base areas and
the Kuomintang areas and they make many mistakes as a consequence. A good
number of comrades have come here from the garrets of Shanghai, and in coming
from those garrets to the revolutionary base areas, they have passed not
only from one kind of place to another but from one historical epoch to another.
One society is semi-feudal, semi-colonial, under the rule of the big landlords
and big bourgeoisie, the other is a revolutionary new-democratic society
under the leadership of the proletariat. To come to the revolutionary bases
means to enter an epoch unprecedented in the thousands of years of Chinese
history, an epoch in which the masses of the people wield state power. Here
the people around us and the audience for our propaganda are totally different.
The past epoch is gone, never to return. Therefore, we must integrate ourselves
with the new masses without any hesitation. If, living among the new masses,
some comrades, as I said before, are still "lacking in knowledge and
understanding" and remain "heroes with no place to display their prowess",
then difficulties will arise for them, and not only when they go out to the
villages; right here in Yenan difficulties will arise for them. Some comrades
may think, "Well, I had better continue writing for the readers in the Great
Rear Area; <B>[<A HREF="#bm10">10</A>]</B> it is a job I know well and has
'national significance'." This idea is entirely wrong. The Great Rear Area
is also changing. Readers there expect authors in the revolutionary base
areas to tell about the new people and the new world and not to bore them
with the same old tales. Therefore, the more a work is written for the masses
in the revolutionary base areas, the more national significance will it have.
Fadeyev in <EM>The Debacle <B>[<A HREF="#bm11">11</A>] </B></EM>only told
the story of a small guerrilla unit and had no intention of pandering to
the palate of readers in the old world; yet the book has exerted world-wide
influence. At any rate in China its influence is very great, as you know.
China is moving forward, not back, and it is the revolutionary base areas,
not any of the backward, retrogressive areas, that are leading China forward.
This is a fundamental issue that, above all, comrades must come to understand
in the rectification movement.
<P>
Since integration into the new epoch of the masses is essential, it is necessary
thoroughly to solve the problem of the relationship between the individual
and the masses. This couplet from a poem by Lu Hsun should be our motto:
<P class="indentb">
<EM>Fierce-browed, I coolly defy a thousand pointing fingers, 
<br>
Head-bowed, like a willing ox I serve the children.</EM>
<B>[<A HREF="#bm12">12</A>]</B>
<P>
The "thousand pointing fingers" are our enemies, and we will never yield
to them, no matter how ferocious. The "children" here symbolize the proletariat
and the masses. All Communists, all revolutionaries, all revolutionary literary
and art workers should learn from the example of Lu Hsun and be "oxen" for
the proletariat and the masses, bending their backs to the task until their
dying day. Intellectuals who want to integrate themselves with the masses,
who want to serve the masses, must go through a process in which they and
the masses come to know each other well. This process may, and certainly
will, involve much pain and friction, but if you have the determination,
you will be able to fulfil these requirements.
<P>
Today I have discussed only some of the problems of fundamental orientation
for our literature and art movement; many specific problems remain which
will require further study. I am confident that comrades here are determined
to move in the direction indicated.
<P>
I believe that in the course of the rectification movement and in the long
period of study and work to come, you will surely be able to bring about
a transformation in yourselves and in your works, to create many fine works
which will be warmly welcomed by the masses of the people, and to advance
the literature and art movement in the revolutionary base areas and throughout
China to a glorious new stage.

<A NAME="bm1">1.</A> See V. I. Lenin, "Party Organisation and Party Literature",
in which he described the characteristics of proletarian literature as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  It will be a free literature, because the idea of socialism and sympathy
  with the working people, and not greed or careerism, will bring ever new
  forces to its ranks. It will be a free literature, because it will serve,
  not some satiated heroine, not the bored "upper ten thousand" suffering from
  fatty degeneration, but the millions and tens of millions of working people--the
  flower of the country, its strength and its future. It will be a free literature,
  enriching the last word in the revolutionary thought of mankind with the
  experience and living work of the socialist proletariat, bringing about permanent
  interaction between the experience of the past (scientific socialism, the
  completion of the development of socialism from its primitive, utopian forms)
  and the experience of the present (the present struggle of the worker comrades).

with only two people acting in it, a cowherd and a village girl, who sing
a question and answer duet. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against
Japan, this form was used, with new words, for anti-Japanese propaganda and
for a time found great favour with the public.

in "Sung Yu's Reply to the King of Chu" in Prince Chao Ming's <EM>Anthology

capital, only a few dozen people joined in, but when the "Song of the Rustic

behind the enemy lines under the leadership of the Communist Party.
