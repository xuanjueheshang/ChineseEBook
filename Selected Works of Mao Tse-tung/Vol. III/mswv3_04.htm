  ON THE INTERNATIONAL UNITED FRONT AGAINST FASCISM
</H1><P CLASS="title">
<EM>June 23, 1941</EM>
<P class="information">
[This inner-party directive was written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China.]
  <hr class="end" />
<P>
On June 22 the fascist rulers of Germany attacked the Soviet Union. This
is a perfidious crime of aggression not only against the Soviet Union but
against the freedom and independence of all nations. The Soviet Union's sacred
war of resistance against fascist aggression is being waged not only in its
own defence but in defence of all the nations struggling to liberate themselves
from fascist enslavement.
<P>
For Communists throughout the world the task now is to mobilize the people
of all countries and organize an international united front to fight fascism
and defend the Soviet Union, defend China, and defend the freedom and
independence of all nations. In the present period, every effort must be
concentrated on combating fascist enslavement.
<P>
For the Chinese Communist Party the tasks throughout the country are as follows:
<P class="indentb">
1. Persevere in the National United Front Against Japan, persevere in
Kuomintang-Communist co-operation, drive the Japanese imperialists out of
China, and by these means assist the Soviet Union.
<P class="indentb">
2. Resolutely combat all the anti-Soviet and anti-Communist activities of
the reactionaries among the big bourgeoisie.
<P class="indentb">
3. In foreign relations, unite against the common foe with everybody in Britain,
the United States and other countries who is opposed to the fascist rulers
of Germany, Italy and Japan.
