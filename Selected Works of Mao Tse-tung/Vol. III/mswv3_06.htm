  RECTIFY THE PARTY'S STYLE OF WORK
</H1><P CLASS="title">
<EM>February 1, 1942</EM>
<P class="information">
[This speech was delivered by Comrade Mao Tse-tung at the opening of the
Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.] 
  <hr class="end" />
<P>
The Party School opens today and I wish it every success.
<P>
I would like to say something about the problem of our Party's style of work.
<P>
Why must there be a revolutionary party? There must be a revolutionary party
because the world contains enemies who oppress the people and the people
want to throw off enemy oppression. In the era of capitalism and imperialism,
just such a revolutionary party as the Communist Party is needed. Without
such a party it is simply impossible for the people to throw off enemy
oppression. We are Communists, we want to lead the people in overthrowing
the enemy, and so we must keep our ranks in good order, we must march in
step, our troops must be picked troops and our weapons good weapons. Without
these conditions the enemy cannot be overthrown.
<P>
What is the problem now facing our Party? The general line of the Party is
correct and presents no problem, and the Party's work has been fruitful.
The Party has several hundred thousand members who are leading the people
in extremely hard and bitter struggles against the enemy. This is plain to
everybody and beyond all doubt.
<P>
Then is there or is there not any problem still facing our Party? I say there
is and, in a certain sense, the problem is quite serious.
<P>
What is the problem? It is the fact that there is something in the minds
of a number of our comrades which strikes one as not quite right, not quite
proper.
<P>
In other words, there is still something wrong with our style of study, with
our style in the Party's internal and external relations and with our style
of writing. By something wrong with the style of study we mean the malady
of subjectivism. By something wrong with our style in Party relations we
mean the malady of sectarianism. By something wrong with the style of writing
we mean the malady of stereotyped Party writing.
<B>[<A HREF="#bm1">1</A>]</B> All these are wrong, they are ill winds, but
they are not like the wintry north winds that sweep across the whole sky.
Subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing are no longer the
dominant styles, but merely gusts of contrary wind, ill winds from the air-raid
tunnels. <EM>(Laugher.) </EM>It is bad, however, that such winds should still
be blowing in the Party. We must seal off the passages which produce them.
Our whole Party should undertake the job of sealing off these passages, and
so should the Party School. These three ill winds, subjectivism, sectarianism
and stereotyped Party writing, have their historical origins. Although no
longer dominant in the whole Party, they still constantly create trouble
and assail us. Therefore, it is necessary to resist them and to study, analyse
and elucidate them.
<P>
Fight subjectivism in order to rectify the style of study, fight sectarianism
in order to rectify the style in Party relations, and fight Party stereotypes
in order to rectify the style of writing--such is the task before us.
<P>
To accomplish the task of overthrowing the enemy, we must accomplish the
task of rectifying these styles within the Party. The style of study and
the style of writing are also the Party's style of work. Once our Party's
style of work is put completely right, the people all over the country will
learn from our example. Those outside the Party who have the same kind of
bad style will, if they are good and honest people, learn from our example
and correct their mistakes, and thus the whole nation will be influenced.
So long as our Communist ranks are in good order and march in step, so long
as our troops are picked troops and our weapons are good weapons, any enemy,
however powerful, can be overthrown.
<P>
Let me speak now about subjectivism.
<P>
Subjectivism is an improper style of study; it is opposed to Marxism-Leninism
and is incompatible with the Communist Party. What we want is the
Marxist-Leninist style of study. What we call style of study means not just
style of study in the schools but in the whole Party. It is a question of
the method of thinking of comrades in our leading bodies, of all cadres and
Party members, a question of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism, of the
attitude of all Party comrades in their work. As such, it is a question of
extraordinary, indeed of primary, importance.
<P>
Certain muddled ideas find currency among many people. There are, for instance,
muddled ideas about what is a theorist, what is an intellectual and what
is meant by linking theory and practice.
<P>
Let us first ask, is the theoretical level of our Party high or low? Recently
more Marxist-Leninist works have been translated and more people have been
reading them. That is a very good thing. But can we therefore say that the
theoretical level of our Party has been greatly raised? True, the level is
now somewhat higher than before. But our theoretical front is very much out
of harmony with the rich content of the Chinese revolutionary movement, and
a comparison of the two shows that the theoretical side is lagging far behind.
Generally speaking, our theory cannot as yet keep pace with our revolutionary
practice, let alone lead the way as it should. We have not yet raised our
rich and varied practice to the proper theoretical plane. We have not yet
examined all the problems of revolutionary practice--or even the important
ones--and raised them to a theoretical plane. Just think, how many of us
have created theories worthy of the name on China's economics, politics,
military affairs or culture, theories which can be regarded as scientific
and comprehensive, and not crude and sketchy? Especially in the field of
economic theory: Chinese capitalism has had a century of development since
the Opium War, and yet not a single theoretical work has been produced which
accords with the realities of China's economic development and is genuinely
scientific. Can we say that in the study of China's economic problems, for
instance, the theoretical level is already high? Can we say that our Party
already has economic theorists worthy of the name? Certainly not. We have
read a great many Marxist-Leninist books, but can we claim, then, that we
have theorists? We cannot. For Marxism-Leninism is the theory created by
Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin on the basis of practice, their general conclusion
drawn from historical and revolutionary reality. If we merely read their
works but do not proceed to study the realities of China's history and revolution
in the light of their theory or do not make any effort to think through China's
revolutionary practice carefully in terms of theory, we should not be so
presumptuous as to call ourselves Marxist theorists. Our achievements on
the theoretical front will be very poor indeed if, as members of the Communist
Party of China, we close our eyes to China's problems and can only memorize
isolated conclusions or principles from Marxist writings. If all a person
can do is to commit Marxist economics or philosophy to memory, reciting glibly
from Chapter I to Chapter X, but is utterly unable to apply them, can he
be considered a Marxist theorist? No! He cannot. What kind of theorists do
we want? We want theorists who can, in accordance with the Marxist-Leninist
stand, viewpoint and method, correctly interpret the practical problems arising
in the course of history and revolution and give scientific explanations
and theoretical elucidations of China's economic, political, military, cultural
and other problems. Such are the theorists we want. To be a theorist of this
kind, a person must have a true grasp of the essence of Marxism-Leninism,
of the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint and method and of the theories of
Lenin and Stalin on the colonial revolution and the Chinese revolution, and
he must be able to apply them in a penetrating and scientific analysis of
China's practical problems and discover the laws of development of these
problems. Such are the theorists we really need.
<P>
The Central Committee of our Party has now made a decision calling upon our
comrades to learn how to apply the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint and
method in the serious study of China's history, and of China's economics,
politics, military affairs and culture, and to analyse every problem concretely
on the basis of detailed material and then draw theoretical conclusions.
This is the responsibility we must shoulder.
<P>
Our comrades in the Party School should not regard Marxist theory as lifeless
dogma. It is necessary to master Marxist theory and apply it, master it for
the sole purpose of applying it. If you can apply the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint
in elucidating one or two practical problems, you should be commended and
credited with some achievement. The more problems you elucidate and the more
comprehensively and profoundly you do so, the greater will be your achievement.
Our Party School should also lay down the rule to grade students good or
poor according to how they look at China's problems after they have studied
Marxism-Leninism, according to whether or not they see the problems clearly
and whether or not they see them at all.
<P>
Next let us talk about the question of the "intellectuals". Since China is
a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country and her culture is not well developed,
intellectuals are particularly treasured. On this question of the intellectuals,
the Central Committee of the Party made the decision
<B>[<A HREF="#bm2">2</A>]</B> over two years ago that we should win over
the great numbers of intellectuals and, insofar as they are revolutionary
and willing to take part in the resistance to Japan, welcome them one and
all. It is entirely right for us to esteem intellectuals, for without
revolutionary intellectuals the revolution cannot triumph. But we all know
there are many intellectuals who fancy themselves very learned and assume
airs of erudition without realizing that such airs are bad and harmful and
hinder their own progress. They ought to be aware of the truth that actually
many so-called intellectuals are, relatively speaking, most ignorant and
the workers and peasants sometimes know more than they do. Here some will
say, "Ha! You are turning things upside down and talking nonsense." (Laughter.)
But, comrades, don't get excited; there is some sense in what I am saying.
<P>
What is knowledge? Ever since class society came into being the world has
had only two kinds of knowledge, knowledge of the struggle for production
and knowledge of the class struggle. Natural science and social science are
the crystallization of these two kinds of knowledge, and philosophy is the
generalization and summation of the knowledge of nature and the knowledge
of society. Is there any other kind of knowledge? No. Now let us take a look
at certain students, those brought up in schools that are completely cut
off from the practical activities of society. What about them? A person goes
from a primary school of this kind all the way through to a university of
the same kind, graduates and is reckoned to have a stock of learning. But
all he has is book-learning; he has not yet taken part in any practical
activities or applied what he has learned to any field of life. Can such
a person be regarded as a completely developed intellectual? Hardly so, in
my opinion, because his knowledge is still incomplete. What then is relatively
complete knowledge? All relatively complete knowledge is formed in two stages:
the first stage is perceptual knowledge, the second is rational knowledge,
the latter being the development of the former to a higher stage. What sort
of knowledge is the students' book-learning? Even supposing all their knowledge
is truth, it is still not knowledge acquired through their own personal
experience, but consists of theories set down by their predecessors in
summarizing experience of the struggle for production and of the class struggle.
It is entirely necessary that students should acquire this kind of knowledge,
but it must be understood that as far as they are concerned such knowledge
is in a sense still one-sided, something which has been verified by others
but not yet by themselves. What is most important is to be good at applying
this knowledge in life and in practice. Therefore, I advise those who have
only book-learning but as yet no contact with reality, and also those with
little practical experience, to realize their own shortcomings and become
a little more modest.
<P>
How can those who have only book-learning be turned into intellectuals in
the true sense? The only way is to get them to take part in practical work
and become practical workers, to get those engaged in theoretical work to
study important practical problems. In this way our aim can be attained.
<P>
What I have said will probably make some people angry. They will say, "According
to your explanation, even Marx would not be regarded as an intellectual."
I say they are wrong. Marx took part in the practice of the revolutionary
movement and also created revolutionary theory. Beginning with the commodity,
the simplest element of capitalism, he made a thorough study of the economic
structure of capitalist society. Millions of people saw and handled commodities
every day but were so used to them that they took no notice. Marx alone studied
commodities scientifically. He carried out a tremendous work of research
into their actual development and derived a thoroughly scientific theory
from what existed universally. He studied nature, history and proletarian
revolution and created dialectical materialism, historical materialism and
the theory of proletarian revolution. Thus Marx became a most completely
developed intellectual, representing the acme of human wisdom; he was
fundamentally different from those who have only book-learning. Marx undertook
detailed investigations and studies in the course of practical struggles,
formed generalizations and then verified his conclusions by testing them
in practical struggles--this is what we call theoretical work. Our Party
needs a large number of comrades who will learn how to do such work. In our
Party there are many comrades who can learn to do this kind of theoretical
research; most of them are intelligent and promising and we should value
them. But they must follow correct principles and not repeat the mistake
of the past. They must discard dogmatism and not confine themselves to ready-made
phrases in books.
<P>
There is only one kind of true theory in this world, theory that is drawn
from objective reality and then verified by objective reality; nothing else
is worthy of the name of theory in our sense. Stalin said that theory becomes
aimless when it is not connected with practice.
<B>[<A HREF="#bm3">3</A>]</B> Aimless theory is useless and false and should
be discarded. We should point the finger of scorn at those who are fond of
aimless theorizing. Marxism-Leninism is the most correct, scientific and
revolutionary truth, born out of and verified by objective reality, but many
who study Marxism-Leninism take it as lifeless dogma, thus impeding the
development of theory and harming themselves as well as other comrades.
<P>
On the other hand, our comrades who are engaged in practical work will also
come to grief if they misuse their experience. True, these people are often
rich in experience, which is very valuable, but it is very dangerous if they
rest content with their own experience. They must realize that their knowledge
is mostly perceptual and partial and that they lack rational and comprehensive
knowledge; in other words, they lack theory and their knowledge, too, is
relatively incomplete. Without comparatively complete knowledge it is impossible
to do revolutionary work well.
<P>
Thus, there are two kinds of incomplete knowledge, one is ready-made knowledge
found in books and the other is knowledge that is mostly perceptual and partial;
both are one-sided. Only an integration of the two can yield knowledge that
is sound and relatively complete.
<P>
In order to study theory, however, our cadres of working-class and peasant
origin must first acquire an elementary education. Without it they cannot
learn Marxist-Leninist theory. Having acquired it, they can study
Marxism-Leninism at any time. In my childhood I never attended a Marxist-Leninist
school and was taught only such things as, "The Master said: 'How pleasant
it is to learn and constantly review what one has
learned.'"<B>[<A HREF="#bm4">4</A>]</B> Though this teaching material was
antiquated, it did me some good because from it I learned to read. Nowadays
we no longer study the Confucian classics but such new subjects as modern
Chinese, history, geography and elementary natural science, which, once learned,
are useful everywhere. The Central Committee of our Party now emphatically
requires that our cadres of working-class and peasant origin should obtain
an elementary education because they can then take up any branch of
study--politics, military science or economics. Otherwise, for all their
rich experience they will never be able to study theory.
<P>
It follows that to combat subjectivism we must enable people of each of these
two types to develop in whichever direction they are deficient and to merge
with the other type. Those with booklearning must develop in the direction
of practice; it is only in this way that they will stop being content with
books and avoid committing dogmatist errors. Those experienced in work must
take up the study of theory and must read seriously; only then will they
be able to systematize and synthesize their experience and raise it to the
level of theory, only then will they not mistake their partial experience
for universal truth and not commit empiricist errors. Dogmatism and empiricism
alike are subjectivism, each originating from an opposite pole.
<P>
Hence there are two kinds of Subjectivism in our Party, dogmatism and empiricism.
Each sees only a part and not the whole. If people are not on guard, do not
realize that such one-sidedness is a shortcoming and do not strive to overcome
it, they are liable to go astray.
<P>
However, of the two kinds of subjectivism, dogmatism is still the greater
danger in our Party. For dogmatists can easily assume a Marxist guise to
bluff, capture and make servitors of cadres of working-class and peasant
origin who cannot easily see through them; they can also bluff and ensnare
the naive youth. If we overcome dogmatism, cadres with book-learning will
readily join with those who have experience and will take to the study of
practical things, and then many good cadres who integrate theory with experience,
as well as some real theorists, will emerge. If we overcome dogmatism, the
comrades with practical experience will have good teachers to help them raise
their experience to the level of theory and so avoid empiricist errors.
<P>
Besides muddled ideas about the "theorist" and the "intellectual", there
is a muddled idea among many comrades about "linking theory and practice",
a phrase they have on their lips every day. They talk constantly about "linking",
but actually they mean "separating", because they make no effort at linking.
How is Marxist-Leninist theory to be linked with the practice of the Chinese
revolution? To use a common expression, it is by "shooting the arrow at the
target". As the arrow is to the target, so is Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese
revolution. Some comrades, however, are "shooting without a target", shooting
at random, and such people are liable to harm the revolution. Others merely
stroke the arrow fondly, exclaiming, "What a fine arrow! What a fine arrow!",
but never want to shoot it. These people are only connoisseurs of curios
and have virtually nothing to do with the revolution. The arrow of
Marxism-Leninism must be used to shoot at the target of the Chinese revolution.
Unless this point is made clear, the theoretical level of our Party can never
be raised and the Chinese revolution can never be victorious.
<P>
Our comrades must understand that we study Marxism-Leninism not for display,
nor because there is any mystery about it, but solely because it is the science
which leads the revolutionary cause of the proletariat to victory. Even now,
there are not a few people who still regard odd quotations from Marxist-Leninist
works as a ready-made panacea which, once acquired, can easily cure all maladies.
These people show childish ignorance, and we should enlighten them. It is
precisely such ignorant people who take Marxism-Leninism as a religious dogma.
To them we should say bluntly, "Your dogma is worthless." Marx, Engels, Lenin
and Stalin have repeatedly stated that our theory is not a dogma but a guide
to action. But such people prefer to forget this statement which is of the
greatest, indeed the utmost, importance. Chinese Communists can be regarded
as linking theory with practice only when they become good at applying the
Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint and method and the teachings of Lenin and
Stalin concerning the Chinese revolution and when, furthermore, through serious
research into the realities of China's history and revolution, they do creative
theoretical work to meet China's needs in different spheres. Merely talking
about linking theory and practice without actually doing anything about it
is of no use, even if one goes on talking for a hundred years. To oppose
the subjectivist, one-sided approach to problems, we must demolish dogmatist
subjectiveness and one-sidedness.
<P>
So much for today about combating subjectivism in order to rectify the style
of study throughout the Party.
<P>
Let me now speak about the question of sectarianism.
<P>
Having been steeled for twenty years, our Party is no longer dominated by
sectarianism. Remnants of sectarianism, however, are still found both in
the Party's internal relations and in its external relations. Sectarian
tendencies in internal relations lead to exclusiveness towards comrades inside
the Party and hinder inner-Party unity and solidarity, while sectarian tendencies
in external relations lead to exclusiveness towards people outside the Party
and hinder the Party in its task of uniting the whole people. Only by uprooting
this evil in both its aspects can the Party advance unimpeded in its great
task of achieving unity among all Party comrades and among all the people
of our country.
<P>
What are the remnants of inner-Party sectarianism? They are mainly as follows:
<P>
First, the assertion of "independence". Some comrades see only the interests
of the part and not the whole; they always put undue stress on that part
of the work for which they themselves are responsible and always wish to
subordinate the interests of the whole to the interests of their own part.
They do not understand the Party's system of democratic centralism; they
do not realize that the Communist Party not only needs democracy but needs
centralization even more. They forget the system of democratic centralism
in which the minority is subordinate to the majority, the lower level to
the higher level, the part to the whole and the entire membership to the
Central Committee. Chang Kuo-tao <B>[<A HREF="#bm5">5</A>]</B> asserted his
"independence" of the Central Committee of the Party and as a result "asserted"
himself into betraying the Party and became a Kuomintang agent. Although
the sectarianism we are now discussing is not of this extremely serious kind,
it must still be guarded against and we must do away completely with all
manifestations of disunity. We should encourage comrades to take the interests
of the whole into account. Every Party member, every branch of work, every
statement and every action must proceed from the interests of the whole Party;
it is absolutely impermissible to violate this principle.
<P>
Those who assert this kind of "independence" are usually wedded to the doctrine
of "me first" and are generally wrong on the question of the relationship
between the individual and the Party. Although in words they profess respect
for the Party, in practice they put themselves first and the Party second.
What are these people after? They are after fame and position and want to
be in the limelight. Whenever they are put in charge of a branch of work,
they assert their "independence". With this aim, they draw some people in,
push others out and resort to boasting, flattery and touting among the comrades,
thus importing the vulgar style of the bourgeois political parties into the
Communist Party. It is their dishonesty that causes them to come to grief.
I believe we should do things honestly, for without an honest attitude it
is absolutely impossible to accomplish anything in this world. Which are
the honest people? Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin are honest, men of science
are honest. Which are the dishonest people? Trotsky, Bukharin, Chen Tu-hsiu
and Chang Kuo-tao are extremely dishonest; and those who assert "independence"
out of personal or sectional interest are dishonest too. All sly people,
all those who do not have a scientific attitude in their work, fancy themselves
resourceful and clever, but in fact they are most stupid and will come to
no good. Students in our Party School must pay attention to this problem.
We must build a centralized, unified Party and make a clean sweep of all
unprincipled factional struggles. We must combat individualism and sectarianism
so as to enable our whole Party to march in step and fight for one common
goal.
<P>
Cadres from the outside and those from the locality must unite and combat
sectarian tendencies. Very careful attention must be given to the relations
between outside and local cadres because many anti-Japanese base areas were
established only after the arrival of the Eighth Route Army or the New Fourth
Army and much of the local work developed only after the arrival of outside
cadres. Our comrades must understand that in these conditions it is possible
for our base areas to be consolidated and for our Party to take root there
only when the two kinds of cadres unite as one and when a large number of
local cadres develop and are promoted; otherwise it is impossible. Both the
outside and the local cadres have their strong and weak points, and to make
any progress they must overcome their own weak points by learning from each
other's strong points. The outside cadres are generally not up to the local
cadres in familiarity with local conditions and links with the masses. Take
me for instance. Although I have been in northern Shensi five or six years,
I am far behind the local comrades in understanding local conditions and
in links with the people here. Our comrades going to the anti-Japanese base
areas in Shansi, Hopei, Shantung and other provinces must pay attention to
this. Moreover, even within the same base area, owing to the fact that some
districts develop earlier and others later, there is a difference between
the local cadres of a district and those from outside it. Cadres who come
from a more developed to a less developed district are also outside cadres
in relation to that locality, and they, too, should pay great attention to
fostering and helping local cadres. Generally speaking, in places where outside
cadres are in charge, it is they who should bear the main responsibility
if their relations with the local cadres are not good. And the chief comrades
in charge should bear greater responsibility. The attention paid to this
problem in some places is still very inadequate. Some people look down on
the local cadres and ridicule them, saying, "What do these locals know?
Clodhoppers!" Such people utterly fail to understand the importance of local
cadres; they know neither the latter's strong points nor their own weaknesses
and adopt an incorrect, sectarian attitude. All outside cadres must cherish
the local cadres and give them constant help and must not be permitted to
ridicule or attack them. Of course, the local cadres on their part must learn
from the strong points of the outside cadres and rid themselves of inappropriate,
narrow views so that they and the outside cadres become as one, with no
distinction between "them" and "us", and thus avoid sectarian tendencies.
<P>
The same applies to the relationship between cadres in army service and other
cadres working in the locality. They must be completely united and must oppose
sectarian tendencies. The army cadres must help the local cadres, and vice
versa. If there is friction between them, each should make allowance for
the other and carry out proper self-criticism. Generally speaking, in places
where army cadres are actually in positions of leadership, it is they who
should bear the main responsibility if their relations with the local cadres
are not good. Only when the army cadres understand their own responsibility
and are modest in their attitude towards the local cadres can the conditions
be created for the smooth progress of our war effort and our work of construction
in the base areas.
<P>
The same applies to the relationship among different army units, different
localities and different departments. We must oppose the tendency towards
selfish departmentalism by which the interests of one's own unit are looked
after to the exclusion of those of others. Whoever is indifferent to the
difficulties of others, refuses to transfer cadres to other units on request,
or releases only the inferior ones, "using the neighbour's field as an outlet
for his overflow", and does not give the slightest consideration to other
departments, localities or people--such a person is a selfish departmentalist
who has entirely lost the spirit of communism. Lack of consideration for
the whole and complete indifference to other departments, localities and
people are characteristics of a selfish departmentalist. We must intensify
our efforts to educate such persons and to make them understand that selfish
departmentalism is a sectarian tendency which will become very dangerous,
if allowed to develop.
<P>
Another problem is the relationship between old and new cadres. Since the
beginning of the War of Resistance, our Party has grown enormously, and large
numbers of new cadres have emerged; that is a very good thing. In his report
to the Eighteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (B.),
Comrade Stalin said, "... there are never enough old cadres, there are far
less than required, and they are already partly going out of commission owing
to the operation of the laws of nature." Here he was discussing the cadres
situation and not only the laws of nature. If our Party does not have a great
many new cadres working in unity and co-operation with the old cadres, our
cause will come to a stop. All old cadres, therefore, should welcome the
new ones with the utmost enthusiasm and show them the warmest solicitude.
True, new cadres have their shortcomings. They have not been long in the
revolution and lack experience, and unavoidably some have brought with them
vestiges of the unwholesome ideology of the old society, remnants of the
ideology of petty-bourgeois individualism. But such shortcomings can be gradually
eliminated through education and tempering in the revolution. The strong
point of the new cadres, as Stalin has said, is that they are acutely sensitive
to what is new and are therefore enthusiastic and active to a high degree--the
very qualities which some of the old cadres lack.
<B>[<A HREF="#bm6">6</A>]</B> Cadres, new and old, should respect each other,
learn from each other and overcome their own shortcomings by learning from
each other's strong points, so as to unite as one in the common cause and
guard against sectarian tendencies. Generally speaking, in places where the
old cadres are mainly in charge, it is they who should bear the chief
responsibility if relations with the new cadres are not good.
<P>
All the above--relations between the part and the whole, relations between
the individual and the Party, relations between outside and local cadres,
relations between army cadres and other cadres working in the locality, relations
between this and that army unit, between this and that locality, between
this and that department and relations between old and new cadres--are relations
within the Party. In all these relations it is necessary to enhance the spirit
of communism and guard against sectarian tendencies, so that the ranks of
our Party will be in good order, march in step and therefore fight well.
This is a very important problem which we must solve thoroughly in rectifying
the Party's style of work. Sectarianism is an expression of subjectivism
in organizational relations; if we want to get rid of subjectivism and promote
the Marxist-Leninist spirit of seeking truth from facts, we must sweep the
remnants of sectarianism out of the Party and proceed from the principle
that the Party's interests are above personal or sectional interests, so
that the Party can attain complete solidarity and unity.
<P>
The remnants of sectarianism must be eliminated from the Party's external
as well as its internal relations. The reason is this: we cannot defeat the
enemy by merely uniting the comrades throughout the Party, we can defeat
the enemy only by uniting the people throughout the country. For twenty years
the Communist Party of China has done great and arduous work in the cause
of uniting the people of the whole country, and the achievements in this
work since the outbreak of the War of Resistance are even greater than in
the past. This does not mean, however, that all our comrades already have
a correct style in dealing with the masses and are free from sectarian
tendencies. No. In fact, sectarian tendencies still exist among a number
of comrades, and in some cases to a very serious degree. Many of our comrades
tend to be overbearing in their relations with non-Party people, look down
upon them, despise or refuse to respect them or appreciate their strong points.
This is indeed a sectarian tendency. After reading a few Marxist books, such
comrades become more arrogant instead of more modest, and invariably dismiss
others as no good without realizing that in fact their own knowledge is only
half-baked. Our comrades must realize the truth that Communist Party members
are at all times a minority as compared with non-Party people. Supposing
one out of every hundred persons were a Communist, then there would be 4,500,000
Communists among China's population of 450,000,000. Yet, even if our membership
reached this huge figure, Communists would still form only one per cent of
the whole population, while 99 per cent would be non-Party people. What reason
can we then have for not co-operating with non-Party people? As regards all
those who wish to co-operate with us or might co-operate with us, we have
only the duty of co-operating and absolutely no right to shut them out. But
some Party members do not understand this and look down upon, or even shut
out, those who wish to co-operate with us. There are no grounds whatsoever
for doing so. Have Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin given us any grounds? They
have not. On the contrary, they have always earnestly enjoined us to form
close ties with the masses and not divorce ourselves from them. Or has the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China given us any grounds? No.
Among all its resolutions there is not a single one that says we may divorce
ourselves from the masses and so isolate ourselves. On the contrary, the
Central Committee has always told us to form close ties with the masses and
not to divorce ourselves from them. Thus any action divorcing us from the
masses has no justification at all and is simply the mischievous result of
the sectarian ideas some of our comrades have themselves concocted. As such
sectarianism remains very serious among some of our comrades and still obstructs
the application of the Party line, we should carry out extensive education
within the Party to meet this problem. Above all, we should make our cadres
really understand how serious the problem is and how utterly impossible it
is to overthrow the enemy and attain the goal of the revolution unless Party
members unite with the non-Party cadres and with non-Party people.
<P>
All sectarian ideas are subjectivist and are incompatible with the real needs
of the revolution; hence the struggle against sectarianism and the struggle
against subjectivism should go on simultaneously.
<P>
There is no time today to talk about the question of stereotyped Party writing;
I shall discuss it at another meeting. Stereotyped Party writing is a vehicle
for filth, a form of expression for subjectivism and sectarianism. It does
people harm and damages the revolution, and we must get rid of it completely.
<P>
To combat subjectivism we must propagate materialism and dialectics. However,
there are many comrades in our Party who lay no stress on the propaganda
either of materialism or of dialectics. Some tolerate subjectivist propaganda
and regard it with equanimity. They think they believe in Marxism, but make
no effort to propagate materialism and do not give it a thought or express
any opinion when they hear or read subjectivist stuff. This is not the attitude
of a Communist. It allows many of our comrades to be poisoned by subjectivist
ideas, which numb their sensitivity. We should therefore launch a campaign
of enlightenment within the Party to free the minds of our comrades from
the fog of subjectivism and dogmatism and should call upon them to boycott
subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing. Such evils are
like Japanese goods, for only our enemy wishes us to preserve them and continue
to befuddle ourselves with them; so we should advocate a boycott against
them, just as we boycott Japanese goods. <B>[<A HREF="#bm7">7</A>]</B> We
should boycott all the wares of subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped
Party writing, make their sale difficult, and not allow their purveyors to
ply their trade by exploiting the low theoretical level in the Party. Our
comrades must develop a good nose for this purpose; they should take a sniff
at everything and distinguish the good from the bad before they decide whether
to welcome it or boycott it. Communists must always go into the whys and
wherefores of anything, use their own heads and carefully think over whether
or not it corresponds to reality and is really well founded; on no account
should they follow blindly and encourage slavishness.
<P>
Finally, in opposing subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing
we must have in mind two purposes: first, "learn from past mistakes to avoid
future ones", and second, "cure the sickness to save the patient". The mistakes
of the past must be exposed without sparing anyone's sensibilities; it is
necessary to analyse and criticize what was bad in the past with a scientific
attitude so that work in the future will be done more carefully and done
better. This is what is meant by "learn from past mistakes to avoid future
ones". But our aim in exposing errors and criticizing shortcomings, like
that of a doctor curing a sickness, is solely to save the patient and not
to doctor him to death. A person with appendicitis is saved when the surgeon
removes his appendix. So long as a person who has made mistakes does not
hide his sickness for fear of treatment or persist in his mistakes until
he is beyond cure, so long as he honestly and sincerely wishes to be cured
and to mend his ways, we should welcome him and cure his sickness so that
he can become a good comrade. We can never succeed if we just let ourselves
go, and lash out at him. In treating an ideological or a political malady,
one must never be rough and rash but must adopt the approach of "curing the
sickness to save the patient", which is the only correct and effective method.
<P>
I have taken this occasion of the opening of the Party School to speak at
length, and I hope comrades will think over what I have said. <EM>(Enthusiastic

<H4><I>NOTES</I></H4>
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm1">1.</A> Stereotyped writing, or the "eight-legged essay", was
the special form of essay prescribed in the imperial examinations under China's
feudal dynasties from the 15th to the 19th centuries; it consisted in juggling
with words, concentrated only on form and was devoid of content. Structurally
the main body of the essay had eight parts--presentation, amplification,
preliminary exposition, initial argument, inceptive paragraphs, middle
paragraphs, rear paragraphs and concluding paragraphs, and the fifth to eighth
parts each had to have two "legs", i.e., two antithetical paragraphs, hence
the name "eight-legged essay". The "eight-legged essay" became a byword in
China denoting stereotyped formalism and triteness. Thus "stereotyped Party
writing", characterizes the writings of certain people in the revolutionary
ranks who piled up revolutionary phrases and terms higgledy-piggledy instead
of analysing the facts. Like the "eight-legged essay", their writings were
nothing but verbiage.

<A NAME="bm5">5.</A> Chang Kuo-tao was a renegade from the Chinese revolution.
In early life, speculating on the revolution he joined the Chinese Communist
Party. In the Party he made many mistakes resulting in serious crimes. The
most notorious of these was his opposition in 1935 to the Red Army's northward
march and his defeatism and liquidationism in advocating withdrawal by the
Red Army to the minority-nationality areas on the Szechuan-Sikang borders;
what is more, he openly carried out traitorous activities against the Party
and the Central Committee, established his own bogus central committee, disrupted
the unity of the Party and the Red Army, and caused heavy losses to the Fourth
Front Army of the Red Army. But thanks to patient education by Comrade Mao
Tse-tung and the Central Committee, the Fourth Front Army and its numerous
cadres soon returned to the correct leadership of the Central Committee of
the Party and played a glorious role in subsequent struggles. Chang Kuo-tao,
however, proved incorrigible and in the spring of 1938 he slipped out of
the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and joined the Kuomintang secret police.
