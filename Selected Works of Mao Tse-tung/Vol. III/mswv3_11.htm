  IN CELEBRATION OF THE TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION
</H1><P CLASS="title">
<EM>November 6, 1942</EM>

<P>
It is with the greatest optimism that we celebrate the anniversary of the
October Revolution this year. I firmly believe that this anniversary marks
the turning point not only of the Soviet-German war, but also of the victory
of the world anti-fascist front over the fascist front.
<P>
Hitler was previously able to keep up the offensive without being defeated
because the Red Army was alone in resisting fascist Germany and its accomplices
in Europe. Now the Soviet Union has grown more powerful in the course of
the war and Hitler's second summer offensive has failed. Henceforward the
task of the world anti-fascist front is to take the offensive against the
fascist front and inflict final defeat on fascism.
<P>
The warriors of the Red Army at Stalingrad have performed prodigies of heroism
which will affect the destiny of mankind. They are the sons and daughters
of the October Revolution. The banner of the October Revolution is invincible,
and all the forces of fascism are doomed to extinction.
<P>
In celebrating the victory of the Red Army, we the Chinese people are also
celebrating our own victory. Our War of Resistance Against Japan has been
going on for more than five years, and although there are still difficulties
ahead the dawn of victory is already in sight. Victory over the Japanese
fascists is not only certain but is not far off.
<P>
It is the task of the Chinese people to concentrate every effort on beating
the Japanese fascists.
