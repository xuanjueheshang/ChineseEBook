  THE LAST ROUND WITH THE JAPANESE INVADERS

<P>
The Chinese people heartily welcome the Soviet government's declaration of
war on Japan on August 8. The Soviet Union's action will very much shorten
the war against Japan. The war is already in its last stage and the time
has come to inflict final defeat on the Japanese aggressors and all their
running dogs. In these circumstances, all the anti-Japanese forces of the
Chinese people should launch a nationwide counter-offensive in close and
effective co-ordination with the operations of the Soviet Union and the other
allied countries. The Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army and the other
armed forces of the people should seize every opportunity to launch extensive
attacks on all the invaders and their running dogs who refuse to surrender,
annihilate their forces, capture their arms and <EM>mat&eacute;riel,
</EM>vigorously expand the Liberated Areas and reduce the areas under enemy
occupation. We must boldly form armed working teams which, by hundreds and
by thousands, should penetrate deep into the rear of the enemy-occupied areas,
organize the people to wreck the enemy's communication lines and fight in
co-ordination with the regular armies. We must boldly arouse the people in
the occupied areas in their tens of millions and immediately organize underground
forces to prepare armed uprisings and to annihilate the enemy in co-ordination
with the troops attacking from without. Meanwhile, the consolidation of the
Liberated Areas must not be neglected. Among the 100 million people there,
and among the people in all other areas as they are liberated, we should
universally carry out the reduction of rent and interest this winter and
next spring, increase production, build up the people's political power and
armed forces, intensify militia work, strengthen army discipline, persistently
develop the united front of all sections of the people and guard against
waste of manpower and material resources. All this is designed to put more
punch into our army's offensive against the enemy. The people of the whole
country must be on their guard to avert the danger of civil war and make
efforts to bring about the formation of a democratic coalition government.
A new stage in China's war of national liberation has arrived, and the people
of the whole country must strengthen their unity and struggle for final victory.
