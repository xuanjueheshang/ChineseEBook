  REFORM OUR STUDY

<P class="information">
[Comrade Mao Tse-tung made this report to a cadres' meeting in Yenan. The
report and the two articles, "Rectify the Party's Style of Work" and "Oppose
Stereotyped Party Writing", are Comrade Mao Tse-tung's basic works on the
rectification movement. In these he summed up, on the ideological plane,
past differences in the Party over the Party line and analysed the
petty-bourgeois ideology and style which, masquerading as Marxism-Leninism,
were prevalent in the Party, and which chiefly manifested themselves in
subjectivist and sectarian tendencies, their form of expression being stereotyped
Party writing. Comrade Mao Tse-tung called for a Party-wide movement of
Marxist-Leninist education to rectify style of work in accordance with the
ideological principles of Marxism-Leninism. His call very quickly led to
a great debate between proletarian and petty-bourgeois ideology inside and
outside the Party. This consolidated the position of proletarian ideology
inside and outside the Party, enabled the broad ranks of cadres to take a
great step forward ideologically and the Party to achieve unprecedented unity.]
  <hr class="end" />
<P>
I propose that we should reform the method and the system of study throughout
the Party. The reasons are as follows:
<H4>
  I
</H4>
<P>
The twenty years of the Communist Party of China have been twenty years in
which the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism has become more and more integrated
with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. If we recall how
superficial meagre our understanding of Marxism-Leninism and of the Chinese
revolution was during our Party's infancy, we can see how much deeper and
richer it is now. For a hundred years, the finest sons and daughters of the
disaster-ridden Chinese nation fought and sacrificed their lives, one stepping
into the breach as another fell, in quest of the truth that would save the
country and the people. This moves us to song and tears. But it was only
after World War I and the October Revolution in Russia that we found
Marxism-Leninism, the best of truths, the best of weapons for liberating
our nation. And the Communist Party of China has been the initiator, propagandist
and organizer in the wielding of this weapon. As soon as it was linked with
the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, the universal truth of Marxism
Leninism gave an entirely new complexion to the Chinese revolution. Since
the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Party, basing itself
on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, has taken a further step in its
study of the concrete practice of this war and in its study of China and
the world today, and has also made a beginning in the study of Chinese history.
These are all very good signs.
<h4>

</h4>
<P>
However, we still have shortcomings, and very big ones too. Unless we correct
these shortcomings, we shall not, in my opinion, be able to take another
step forward in our work and in our great cause of integrating the universal
truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution.
<P>
First, take the study of current conditions. We have achieved some success
in our study of present domestic and international conditions, but for such
a large political party as ours, the material we have collected is fragmentary
and our research work unsystematic on each and every aspect of these subjects,
whether it be the political, military, economic or cultural aspect. Generally
speaking, in the last twenty years we have not done systematic and thorough
work in collecting and studying material on these aspects, and we are lacking
in a climate of investigation and study of objective reality. To behave like
"a blindfolded man catching sparrows", or "a blind man groping for fish",
to be crude and careless, to indulge in verbiage, to rest content with a
smattering of knowledge--such is the extremely bad style of work that still
exists among many comrades in our Party, a style utterly opposed to the
fundamental spirit of Marxism-Leninism. Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin have
taught us that it is necessary to study conditions conscientiously and to
proceed from objective reality and not from subjective wishes; but many of
our comrades act in direct violation of this truth.
<P>
Second, take the study of history. Although a few Party members and sympathizers
have undertaken this work, it has not been done in an organized way. Many
Party members are still in a fog about Chinese history, whether of the last
hundred years or of ancient times. There are many Marxist-Leninist scholars
who cannot open their mouths without citing ancient Greece; but as for their
own ancestors--sorry, they have been forgotten. There is no climate of serious
study either of current conditions or of past history.
<P>
Third, take the study of international revolutionary experience, the study
of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. Many comrades seem to study
Marxism-Leninism not to meet the needs of revolutionary practice, but purely
for the sake of study. Consequently, though they read, they cannot digest.
They can only cite odd quotations from Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin in
a one-sided manner, but are unable to apply the stand, viewpoint and method
of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin to the concrete study of China's present
conditions and her history or to the concrete analysis and solution of the
problems of the Chinese revolution. Such an attitude towards Marxism-Leninism
does a great deal of harm, particularly among cadres of the middle and higher
ranks.
<P>
The three aspects I have just mentioned, neglect of the study of current
conditions, neglect of the study of history and neglect of the application
of Marxism-Leninism, all constitute an extremely bad style of work. Its spread
has harmed many of our comrades.
<P>
There are indeed many comrades in our ranks who have been led astray by this
style of work. Unwilling to carry on systematic and thorough investigation
and study of the specific conditions inside and outside the country, the
province, county or district, they issue orders on no other basis than their
scanty knowledge and "It must be so because it seems so to me". Does not
this subjectivist style still exist among a great many comrades?
<P>
There are some who are proud, instead of ashamed, of knowing nothing or very
little of our own history. What is particularly significant is that very
few really know the history of the Communist Party of China and the history
of China in the hundred years since the Opium War. Hardly anyone has seriously
taken up the study of the economic, political, military and cultural history
of the last hundred years. Ignorant of their own country, some people can
only relate tales of ancient Greece and other foreign lands, and even this
knowledge is quite pathetic, consisting of odds and ends from old foreign
books.
<P>
For several decades, many of the returned students from abroad have suffered
from this malady. Coming home from Europe, America or Japan, they can only
parrot things foreign. They become gramophones and forget their duty to
understand and create new things. This malady has also infected the Communist
Party.
<P>
Although we are studying Marxism, the way many of our people study it runs
directly counter to Marxism. That is to say, they violate the fundamental
principle earnestly enjoined on us by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, the
unity of theory and practice. Having violated this principle, they invent
an opposite principle of their own, the separation of theory from practice.
In the schools and in the education of cadres at work, teachers of philosophy
do not guide students to study the logic of the Chinese revolution; teachers
of economics do not guide them to study the characteristics of the Chinese
economy; teachers of political science do not guide them to study the tactics
of the Chinese revolution; teachers of military science do not guide them
to study the strategy and tactics adapted to China's special features; and
so on and so forth. Consequently, error is disseminated, doing people great
harm. A person does not know how to apply in Fuhsien
<B>[<A HREF="#bm1">1</A>]</B> what he has learned in Yenan. Professors of
economics cannot explain the relationship between the Border Region currency
and the Kuomintang currency, <B>[<A HREF="#bm2">2</A>]</B> so naturally the
students cannot explain it either. Thus a perverse mentality has been created
among many students; instead of showing an interest in China's problems and
taking the Party's directives seriously, they give all their hearts to the
supposedly eternal and immutable dogmas learned from their teachers.
<P>
Of course, what I have just said refers to the worst type in our Party, and
I am not saying that it is the general case. However, people of this type
do exist; what is more, there are quite a few of them and they cause a great
deal of harm. This matter should not be treated lightly.
<H4>
  III
</h4>
<P>
In order to explain this idea further, I should like to contrast two opposite
attitudes.
<P>
First, there is the subjectivist attitude.
<P>
With this attitude, a person does not make a systematic and thorough study
of the environment, but works by sheer subjective enthusiasm and has a blurred
picture of the face of China today. With this attitude, he chops up history,
knows only ancient Greece but not China and is in a fog about the China of
yesterday and the day before yesterday. With this attitude, a person studies
Marxist-Leninist theory in the abstract and without any aim. He goes to Marx,
Engels, Lenin and Stalin not to seek the stand, viewpoint and method with
which to solve the theoretical and tactical problems of the Chinese revolution
but to study theory purely for theory's sake. He does not shoot the arrow
at the target but shoots at random. Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin have taught
us that we should proceed from objective realities and that we should derive
laws from them to serve as our guide to action. For this purpose, we should,
as Marx has said, appropriate the material in detail and subject it to scientific
analysis and synthesis. <B>[<A HREF="#bm3">3</A>]</B> Many of our people
do not act in this way but do the opposite. A good number of them are doing
research work but have no interest in studying either the China of today
or the China of yesterday and confine their interest to the study of empty
"theories" divorced from reality. Many others are doing practical work, but
they too pay no attention to the study of objective conditions, often rely
on sheer enthusiasm and substitute their personal feelings for policy. Both
kinds of people, relying on the subjective, ignore the existence of objective
realities. When making speeches, they indulge in a long string of headings,
A, B, C, D, 1, 2, 3, 4, and when writing articles, they turn out a lot of
verbiage. They have no intention of seeking truth from facts, but only a
desire to curry favour by claptrap. They are flashy without substance, brittle
without solidity. They are always right, they are the Number One authority
under Heaven, "imperial envoys" who rush everywhere. Such is the style of
work of some comrades in our ranks. To govern one's own conduct by this style
is to harm oneself, to teach it to others is to harm others, and to use it
to direct the revolution is to harm the revolution. To sum up, this subjectivist
method which is contrary to science and Marxism-Leninism is a formidable
enemy of the Communist Party, the working class, the people and the nation;
it is a manifestation of impurity in Party spirit. A formidable enemy stands
before us, and we must overthrow him. Only when subjectivism is overthrown
can the truth of Marxism-Leninism prevail, can Party spirit be strengthened,
can the revolution be victorious. We must assert that the absence of a scientific
attitude, that is, the absence of the Marxist-Leninist approach of uniting
theory and practice, means that Party spirit is either absent or deficient.
<P>
There is a couplet which portrays this type of person. It runs:
<P>
<EM>The reed growing on the wall--top-heavy, thin-stemmed and shallow of
root;</EM>
<P>
<EM>The bamboo shoot in the hills--sharp-tongued, thick-skinned and hollow
inside.</EM>
<P>
Is this not an apt description of those who do not have a scientific attitude,
who can only recite words and phrases from the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin
and Stalin and who enjoy a reputation unwarranted by any real learning? If
anyone really wishes to cure himself of his malady, I advise him to commit
this couplet to memory or to show still more courage and paste it on the
wall of his room. Marxism-Leninism is a science, and science means honest,
solid knowledge; there is no room for playing tricks. Let us, then, be honest.
<P>
Secondly, there is the Marxist-Leninist attitude.
<P>
With this attitude, a person applies the theory and method of Marxism-Leninism
to the systematic and thorough investigation and study of the environment.
He does not work by enthusiasm alone but, as Stalin says, combines revolutionary
sweep with practicalness. <B>[<A HREF="#bm4">4</A>]</B> With this attitude
he will not chop up history. It is not enough for him to know ancient Greece,
he must know China; he must know the revolutionary history not only of foreign
countries but also of China, not only the China of today but also the China
of yesterday and of the day before yesterday. With this attitude, one studies
the theory of Marxism-Leninism with a purpose, that is, to integrate
Marxist-Leninist theory with the actual movement of the Chinese revolution
and to seek from this theory the stand, viewpoint and method with which to
solve the theoretical and tactical problems of the Chinese revolution. Such
an attitude is one of shooting the arrow at the target. The "target" is the
Chinese revolution, the "arrow" is Marxism-Leninism. We Chinese Communists
have been seeking this arrow because we want to hit the target of the Chinese
revolution and of the revolution of the East. To take such an attitude is
to seek truth from facts. "Facts" are all the things that exist objectively,
"truth" means their internal relations, that is, the laws governing them,
and "to seek" means to study. We should proceed from the actual conditions
inside and outside the country, the province, county or district, and derive
from them, as our guide to action, laws which are inherent in them and not
imaginary, that is, we should find the internal relations of the events occurring
around us. And in order to do that we must rely not on subjective imagination,
not on momentary enthusiasm, not on lifeless books, but on facts that exist
objectively; we must appropriate the material in detail and, guided by the
general principles of Marxism-Leninism, draw correct conclusions from it.
Such conclusions are not mere lists of phenomena in A, B, C, D order or writings
full of platitudes, but are scientific conclusions. Such an attitude is one
of seeking truth from facts and not of currying favour by claptrap. It is
the manifestation of Party spirit, the Marxist-Leninist style of uniting
theory and practice. It is the attitude every Communist Party member should
have at the very least. He who adopts this attitude will be neither "top-heavy,
thin-stemmed and shallow of root" nor "sharp-tongued, thick-skinned and hollow
inside".

</h4>
<P>
In accordance with the above views, I would like to make the following proposals:
<P>
1. We should place before the whole Party the task of making a systematic
and thorough study of the situation around us. On the basis of the theory
and method of Marxism-Leninism, we should make a detailed investigation and
study of developments in the economic, financial, political, military, cultural
and party activities of our enemies, our friends and ourselves, and then
draw the proper and necessary conclusions. To this end, we should direct
our comrades' attention to the investigation and study of these practical
matters. We should get our comrades to understand that the twofold basic
task of the leading bodies of the Communist Party is to know conditions and
to master policy; the former means knowing the world and the latter changing
the world. We should get our comrades to understand that without investigation
there is no right to speak, and that bombastic twaddle and a mere list of
phenomena in 1, 2, 3, 4 order are of no use. Take propaganda work, for instance;
if we do not know the situation with regard to the propaganda of our enemies,
our friends and ourselves, we shall be unable to decide on a correct propaganda
policy. In the work of any department, it is necessary to know the situation
first and only then can the work be well handled. The fundamental link in
changing the Party's style of work is to carry out plans for investigation
and study throughout the Party.
<P>
2. As for China's history in the last hundred years, we should assemble qualified
persons to study it, in co-operation and with a proper division of labour,
and so overcome the present disorganized state of affairs. First it is necessary
to make analytical studies in the several fields of economic history, political
history, military history and cultural history, and only then will it be
possible to make synthetical studies.
<P>
3. As for education for cadres whether at work or in schools for cadres,
a policy should be established of focusing such education on the study of
the practical problems of the Chinese revolution and using the basic principles
of Marxism-Leninism as the guide, and the method of studying Marxism-Leninism
statically and in isolation should be discarded. Moreover, in studying
Marxism-Leninism, we should use the <EM>History of the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), Short Course </EM>as the principal material.
It is the best synthesis and summing-up of the world communist movement of
the past hundred years, a model of the integration of theory and practice,
and so far the only comprehensive model in the whole world. When we see how
Lenin and Stalin integrated the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete
practice of the Soviet revolution and thereby developed Marxism, we shall
know how we should work in China.
<P>
We have made many detours. But error is often the precursor of what is correct.
I am confident that in the context of the Chinese revolution and the world
revolution, which is so intensely alive and so richly varied, this reform
of our study will certainly yield good results.
