<P>
In carrying out the Land Law, it is necessary to distinguish three kinds
of areas and to adopt different tactics for each.
<P>
1. Old Liberated Areas established before the Japanese surrender. In general,
land in these areas has long been distributed, and only a part of the
distribution needs to be readjusted. Our work here should centre on educating
and consolidating the ranks of the Party and solving the contradictions between
the Party and the masses by combining the efforts of Party and non-Party
people according to the experience gained in Pingshan
County.<B>[<A href="#bm1">1</A>]</B> In these old Liberated Areas what should
be done is not to distribute the land a second time under the Land Law, or
artificially and arbitrarily to organize poor peasant leagues to lead the
peasant associations, but to organize poor peasant groups within the peasant
associations. Activists in these groups can hold leading posts in the peasant
associations and in the organs of political power in the rural areas, but
it should not be made the rule that such posts go to the poor peasants to
the exclusion of the middle peasants. In these areas the leading posts in
the peasant associations and the organs of political power should be assumed
by those activists among the poor and middle peasants who are correct in
their thinking and fair and just in running affairs. The great majority of
former poor peasants in these areas have developed into middle peasants,
and the middle peasants now form the bulk of the rural population; therefore
we must draw in the activists among the middle peasants to participate in
the leadership of these rural areas.
<P>
2. Areas liberated between the Japanese surrender and the time of the general
counter-offensive, that is, in the two years between September 1945 and August
1947. These now form the largest part of the Liberated Areas and can be called
the semi-old Liberated Areas.
<P>
In these areas, through the struggle to settle accounts during the last two
years and through the carrying out of the "May 4th
Directive",<B>[<A href="#bm2">2</A>]</B> the level of political consciousness
and the degree of organization of the masses have been raised considerably,
and there has been a preliminary solution of the land problem. But the political
consciousness and the organization of the masses have not yet reached a high
level, and the land problem is not yet thoroughly solved. In these areas
the Land Law is entirely applicable, the distribution of land should be universal
and thorough, and if it is not done well the first time, we should be prepared
for a second distribution with one or two check-ups afterwards. In these
areas the middle peasants are a minority and are taking a wait-and-see attitude.
The poor peasants are the majority and are eagerly demanding land. Poor peasant
leagues must therefore be organized and their leading position established
in the peasant associations and the organs of political power in the rural
areas.
<P>
3. Areas newly liberated since the general counter-offensive. In these areas
the masses have not yet been aroused, the Kuomintang, the landlords and the
rich peasants still have great influence, and all our work has not yet taken
root. Therefore, we should not try to enforce the Land Law all at once but
should do it in two stages. The first stage is to neutralize the rich peasants
and strike blows exclusively at the landlords. This stage should be further
sub-divided into several steps, namely, propaganda, preliminary organization,
distribution of the movable property<B>[<A href="#bm3">3</A>]</B> of the
big landlords, distribution of the land of the big and middle landlords with
some consideration being given to the small landlords, and finally the
distribution of the land of the landlord class. During this stage, poor peasant
leagues should be organized as the backbone of leadership, and peasant
associations may also be organized with the poor peasants as the main body.
The second stage is to distribute the land rented out by the rich peasants,
their surplus land[<A href="#bm4">4</A>] and part of their other property,
and to distribute that portion of the land of the landlords which was not
thoroughly distributed in the first stage. The first stage should take about
two years and the second a year. Haste will certainly do no good. Land reform
and Party consolidation in the old and semi-old Liberated Areas should also
take three years (counting from this January); here haste will do no good
either.

<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm1">1.</A> Pingshan County situated in western Hopei Province,
was then part of the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei Liberated Area. The experience of
Pingshan here referred to consisted in inviting non-Party people to attend
Party meetings so as to help the consolidation of the Party's primary
organizations in the rural areas during the land reform.

issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 4,
1946. See "A Three Months Summary", Note 4, p. 118 of this volume.
