[This is a very important statement made by Comrade Mao Tse-tung on the
international and domestic situation not long after the conclusion of World
War II. Here, Comrade Mao Tse-tung put forward his famous thesis, "All
reactionaries are paper tigers." This thesis armed the people of our country
ideologically, strengthened their confidence in victory and played an exceedingly
great role in the People's War of Liberation. Just as Lenin considered
imperialism a "colossus with feet of clay", so Comrade Mao Tse-tung regards
imperialism and all reactionaries as paper tigers; both have dealt with the
essence of the matter. This thesis is a fundamental strategic concept for
the revolutionary people. Since the period of the Second Revolutionary Civil
War, Comrade Mao Tse-tung has repeatedly pointed out: strategically, with
regard to the whole, revolutionaries must despise the enemy, dare to struggle
against him and dare to seize victory; at the same time, tactically, with
regard to each part, each specific struggle, they must take the enemy seriously,
be prudent, carefully study and perfect the art of struggle and adopt forms
of struggle suited to different times, places and conditions in order to
isolate and wipe out the enemy step by step. On December 1, 1958, at a meeting
of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China held at Wuchang, Comrade Mao Tse-tung stated<B>: </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Just as there is not a single thing in the world without a dual nature (this
  is the law of the unity of opposites), so imperialism and all reactionaries
  have a dual nature -- they are real tigers and paper tigers at the same time.
  In past history, before they won state power and for some time afterwards,
  the slave-owning class, the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie were
  vigorous, revolutionary and progressive; they were real tigers. But with
  the lapse of time, because their opposites -- the slave class, the peasant
  class and the proletariat -- grew in strength step by step, struggled against
  them and became more and more formidable, these ruling classes changed step
  by step into the reverse, changed into reactionaries, changed into backward
  people, changed into paper tigers. And eventually they were overthrown, or
  will be overthrown, by the people. The reactionary, backward, decaying classes
  retained this dual nature even in their last life-and-death struggles against
  the people. On the one hand, they were real tigers; they ate people, ate
  people by the millions and tens of millions. The cause of the people's struggle
  went through a period of difficulties and hardships, and along the path there
  were many twists and turns. To destroy the rule of imperialism, feudalism
  and bureaucrat-capitalism in China took the Chinese people more than a hundred
  years and cost them tens of millions of lives before the victory in 1949.
  Look! Were these not living tigers, iron tigers, real tigers? But in the
  end they changed into paper tigers, dead tigers, bean-curd tigers. These
  are historical facts. Have people not seen or heard about these facts? There
  have indeed been thousands and tens of thousands of them! Thousands and tens
  of thousands! Hence, imperialism and all reactionaries, looked at in essence,
  from a long-term point of view, from a strategic point of view, must be seen
  for what they are -- paper tigers. On this we should build our strategic
  thinking. On the other hand, they are also living tigers, iron tigers, real
  tigers which can eat people. On this we should build our tactical thinking.

<p><EM>Strong: </EM>Do you think there is hope for a political,
a peaceful settlement of China's problems in the near future?
<P>
<EM>Mao: </EM>That depends on the attitude of the U.S. government. If the
American people stay the hands of the American reactionaries who are helping
Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war, there is hope for peace.
<P>
<EM>Strong: </EM>Suppose the United States gives Chiang Kai-shek no help,
besides that already given, <B>[<A href="#bm1">1</A>] </B>how long can Chiang
Kai-shek keep on fighting?
<P>
<EM>Mao: </EM>More than a year.
<P>
<EM>Strong: </EM>Can Chiang Kai-shek keep on that long, economically?
<P>
<EM>Mao: </EM>He can.
<P>
<EM>Strong: </EM>What if the United States makes it clear that it will give
Chiang Kai-shek no more help from now on?
<P>
<EM>Mao: </EM>There is no sign yet that the U.S. government and Chiang Kai-shek
have any desire to stop the war within a short time.
<P>
<EM>Strong: </EM>How long can the Communist Party keep on?
<P>
<EM>Mao: </EM>As far as our own desire is concerned, we don't want to fight
even for a single day. But if circumstances force us to fight, we can fight
to the finish.
<P>
<EM>Strong: </EM>If the American people ask why the Communist Party is fighting,
what should I reply?
<P>
<EM>Mao: </EM>Because Chiang Kai-shek is out to slaughter the Chinese people,
and if the people want to survive they have to defend themselves. This the
American people can understand.
<P>
<EM>Strong: </EM>What do you think of the possibility of the United States
starting a war against the Soviet Union?
<P>
<EM>Mao: </EM>There are two aspects to the propaganda about an anti-Soviet
war. On the one hand, U.S. imperialism is indeed preparing a war against
the Soviet Union; the current propaganda about an anti-Soviet war, as well
as other anti-Soviet propaganda, is political preparation for such a war.
On the other hand, this propaganda is a smoke-screen put up by the U.S.
reactionaries to cover many actual contradictions immediately confronting
U.S. imperialism. These are the contradictions between the U.S. reactionaries
and the American people and the contradictions of U.S. imperialism with other
capitalist countries and with the colonial and semi-colonial countries. At
present, the actual significance of the U.S. slogan of waging an anti-Soviet
war is the oppression of the American people and the expansion of the U.S.
forces of aggression in the rest of the capitalist world. As you know, both
Hitler and his partners, the Japanese warlords, used anti-Soviet slogans
for a long time as a pretext for enslavement of the people at home and aggression
against other countries. Now the U.S. reactionaries are acting in exactly
the same way.
<P>
To start a war, the U.S. reactionaries must first attack the American people.
They are already attacking the American people - oppressing the workers and
democratic circles in the United States politically and economically and
preparing to impose fascism there. The people of the United States should
stand up and resist the attacks of the U.S. reactionaries. I believe they
will.
<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union are separated by a vast zone which
includes many capitalist, colonial and semi-colonial countries in Europe,
Asia and Africa. Before the U.S. reactionaries have subjugated these countries,
an attack on the Soviet Union is out of the question. In the Pacific the
United States now controls areas larger than all the former British spheres
of influence there put together; it controls Japan, that part of China under
Kuomintang rule, half of Korea, and the South Pacific. It has long controlled
Central and South America. It seeks also to control the whole of the British
Empire and Western Europe. Using various pretexts, the United States is making
large-scale military arrangements and setting up military bases in many
countries. The U.S. reactionaries say that the military bases they have set
up and are preparing to set up all over the world are aimed against the Soviet
Union. True, these military bases are directed against the Soviet Union.
At present, however, it is not the Soviet Union but the countries in which
these military bases are located that are the first to suffer U.S. aggression.
I believe it won't be long before these countries come to realize who is
really oppressing them, the Soviet Union or the United States. The day will
come when the U.S. reactionaries find themselves opposed by the people of
the whole world.
<P>
Of course, I do not mean to say that the U.S. reactionaries have no intention
of attacking the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is a defender of world peace
and a powerful factor preventing the domination of the world by the U.S.
reactionaries. Because of the existence of the Soviet Union, it is absolutely
impossible for the reactionaries in the United States and the world to realize
their ambitions. That is why the U.S. reactionaries rabidly hate the Soviet
Union and actually dream of destroying this socialist state. But the fact
that the U.S. reactionaries are now trumpeting so loudly about a U.S.-Soviet
war and creating a foul atmosphere, so soon after the end of World War II,
compels us to take a look at their real aims. It turns out that under the
cover of anti-Soviet slogans they are frantically attacking the workers and
democratic circles in the United States and turning all the countries which
are the targets of U.S. external expansion into U.S. dependencies. I think
the American people and the peoples of all countries menaced by U.S. aggression
should unite and struggle against the attacks of the U.S. reactionaries and
their running dogs in these countries. Only by victory in this struggle can
a third world war be avoided; otherwise it is unavoidable.
<P>
<EM>Strong: </EM>That is very clear. But suppose the United States uses the
atom bomb? Suppose the United States bombs the Soviet Union from its bases
in Iceland, Okinawa and China?
<P>
<EM>Mao: </EM>The atom bomb is a paper tiger which the U.S. reactionaries
use to scare people. It looks terrible, but in fact it isn't. Of course,
the atom bomb is a weapon of mass slaughter, but the outcome of a war is
decided by the people, not by one or two new types of weapon.
<P>
All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are
terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful. From a long-term point
of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful.
In Russia, before the February Revolution in 1917, which side was really
strong? On the surface the tsar was strong but he was swept away by a single
gust of wind in the February Revolution. In the final analysis, the strength
in Russia was on the side of the Soviets of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers.
The tsar was just a paper tiger. Wasn't Hitler once considered very strong?
But history proved that he was a paper tiger. So was Mussolini, so was Japanese
imperialism. On the contrary, the strength of the Soviet Union and of the
people in all countries who loved democracy and freedom proved much greater
than had been foreseen.
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek and his supporters, the U.S. reactionaries, are all paper
tigers too. Speaking of U.S. imperialism, people seem to feel that it is
terrifically strong. Chinese reactionaries are using the "strength" of the
United States to frighten the Chinese people. But it will be proved that
the U.S. reactionaries, like all the reactionaries in history, do not have
much strength. In the United States there are others who are really strong
-- the American people.
<P>
Take the case of China. We have only millet plus rifles to rely on, but history
will finally prove that our millet plus rifles is more powerful than Chiang
Kai-shek's aeroplanes plus tanks. Although the Chinese people still face
many difficulties and will long suffer hardships from the joint attacks of
U.S. imperialism and the Chinese reactionaries, the day will come when these
reactionaries are defeated and we are victorious. The reason is simply this:
the reactionaries represent reaction, we represent progress.

<I><B>NOTES</B> </I>
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm1">1.</A> To help Chiang Kai-shek start civil war against the
people, U.S. imperialism gave his government a very great amount of aid.
By the end of June 1946 the United States had equipped 45 Kuomintang divisions.
It had trained 150,000 Kuomintang military personnel - army, naval and air
forces, secret agents, communications police, staff officers, medical officers,
supply personnel, etc. U.S. warships and aircraft transported to the front
against the Liberated Areas 14 Kuomintang corps (41 divisions) and 8 regiments
of the communications police corps, or over 540,000 men in all. The U.S.
government landed 90,000 of its marines in China and stationed them at such
important cities as Shanghai, Tsingtao, Tientsin, Peiping and Chinwangtao.
They guarded the lines of communication for the Kuomintang in northern China.
According to data disclosed in <EM>United States Relations with China </EM>(The
White Paper), released by the State Department on August 5, 1949, the total
value of various kinds of U.S. aid given to the Chiang Kai-shek government
from the time of the War of Resistance Against Japan to 1948 was more than
4,500 million dollars (the overwhelming bulk of U.S. aid given during the
War of Resistance had been hoarded by the Kuomintang for the ensuing civil
war against the people). But the actual amount of U.S. aid to Chiang Kai-shek
far exceeded this total. The U.S. White Paper admitted that U.S. aid was
equivalent to "more than 50 percent of the monetary expenditures" of the
Chiang Kai-shek government and was of "proportionately greater magnitude
in relation to the budget of that Government than the United States has provided
to any nation of Western Europe since the end of the war".
