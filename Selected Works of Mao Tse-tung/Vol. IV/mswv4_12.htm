  <B>SMASH CHIANG KAI-SHEK'S OFFENSIVE BY A WAR OF SELF-DEFENCE</B>
</H1>
<p class="title">
<EM>July 20, 1946</EM>
<P class="information">
[This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China. Chiang Kai-shek tore up the "October
10th Agreement" in the winter of 1945, but his preparations for an all-out
civil war were not complete, mainly because large numbers of Kuomintang troops
had not yet been moved to the civil war fronts. Consequently, in January
1946, under the pressure of the demand of the entire people for peace and
democracy, the Kuomintang government had to convene the Political Consultative
Conference with the participation of the Communist Party of China and other
democratic parties. The Conference adopted a series of resolutions favourable
to peace and democracy, and on January 10 the Kuomintang government issued
an order to cease fire. Chiang Kai-shek was not willing to observe the
resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the cease-fire order.
In the first half of 1946 the Kuomintang troops continued to attack the Liberated
Areas at many points, the attack in the Northeast being on a particularly
large scale, and a situation was created with small-scale fighting south
of the Great Wall and large-scale fighting north of it. Meanwhile the United
States made very great efforts to transport and equip the Kuomintang troops.
By the end of June 1946 Chiang Kai-shek and his U.S. masters thought that
they were fully prepared and could wipe out the whole People's Liberation
Army in three to six months. Accordingly, they launched an all-out offensive
against the Liberated Areas, which began on June 26 with a massive encircling
attack on the Central Plains Liberated Area. Between July and September the
Kuomintang troops started successive large-scale attacks against the Liberated
Areas of Kiangsu-Anhwei, Shantung, Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan,
Shansi-Chahar-Hopei and Shansi-Suiyuan. In October they launched another
large-scale attack on the Northeast Liberated Area. At the same time they
continued to encircle the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Liberated Area with large
numbers of troops. When the country-wide civil war broke out, the Kuomintang
employed 193 brigades (divisions), or some 1,600,000 of its regular troops,
to attack the Liberated Areas; they constituted 80 per cent of its total
strength of 248 regular brigades (divisions), or 2,000,000 men. Under the
leadership of the Central Committee of the Party and its bureaus and sub-bureaus,
the army and people in the Liberated Areas fought heroically against the
offensive of Chiang Kai-shek's Troops. At that time there were six major
theatres of war in the Liberated Areas. These six theatres of war and the
forces of the People's Liberation Army fighting there were<B>: </B>

<P class="information">
The People's Liberation Army, then totalling about 1,200,000 troops, was
outnumbered by the enemy. It correctly carried out the strategy laid down
by Comrade Mao Tse-tung and struck incessant, powerful blows at the invading
enemy. After wiping out 66 regular brigades and some irregular units of the
enemy, totalling more than 710,000 men, in about eight months, the People's
Liberation Army halted the enemy's all-out offensive. Then, step by step,
it unfolded its strategic counter-offensive.] 
  <hr class="end" />

<p>1. Chiang Kai-shek, after violating the truce agreement,
<B>[<A href="#bm1">1</A>]</B> violating the resolutions of the Political
Consultative Conference<B> [<A href="#bm2">2</A>]</B> and occupying Szepingkai,
Changchun and other cities of ours in the Northeast, is now launching another
large-scale offensive against us in eastern and northern China; later, he
may again attack the Northeast. Only after completely smashing Chiang's offensive
in a war of self-defence can the Chinese people regain peace.
<P>
2. Our Party and our army are making every preparation to smash Chiang Kai-shek's
offensive and thus to win peace. Although Chiang Kai-shek has U.S. aid, the
feelings of the people are against him, the morale of his troops is low,
and his economy is in difficulty. As for us, although we have no foreign
aid, the feelings of the people are for us, the morale of our troops is high,
and we can handle our economy. Therefore, we can defeat Chiang Kai-shek.
The whole Party should be fully confident of this.
<P>
3. For defeating Chiang Kai-shek the general method of fighting is mobile
warfare. Therefore, the temporary abandonment of certain places or cities
is not only unavoidable but also necessary. Certain places or cities are
temporarily abandoned in order to win final victory, which would otherwise
be impossible. We must make all Party members and all the people in the Liberated
Areas understand this so that they will be mentally prepared.
<P>
4. In order to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive we must cooperate closely
with the masses of the people and win over all who can be won over. In the
rural areas, on the one hand, we should resolutely solve the land problem,
rely firmly on the farm labourers and poor peasants and unite with the middle
peasants; on the other hand, when solving the land problem, we should distinguish
the ordinary rich peasants and middle and small landlords from the traitors,
bad gentry and local tyrants. We should be more strict in our treatment of
the traitors, bad gentry and local tyrants, and more lenient in our treatment
of the rich peasants and middle and small landlords. In places where the
land problem has already been solved, we should change to a moderate attitude
towards the landlord class as a whole, with the exception of a few reactionaries.
In order to reduce the number of hostile elements and to consolidate the
Liberated Areas, we should help all those landlords who have difficulty in
making a living and induce runaway landlords to return and give them an
opportunity to earn a living. In the cities, besides uniting with the working
class, the petty bourgeoisie and all progressives, we should take care to
unite with all the middle elements and isolate the reactionaries. Among the
Kuomintang troops, we should win over all the possible opponents of civil
war and isolate the bellicose elements.
<P>
5. In order to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive we must plan on a long-term
basis. We must use our manpower and material resources with the utmost economy
and do everything possible to avoid waste. We must investigate and clean
up the petty graft which has appeared in some places. We must work hard in
production in order to become completely self-sufficient in all necessities
and first of all in grain and cloth. We must promote the extensive planting
of cotton and encourage every family to spin and every village to weave.
We should start to promote this even in the Northeast. In the spheres of
finance and supplies, we must meet the material needs of the war of self-defence
and at the same time lighten the burden on the people, so that there will
be some improvement in the livelihood of the people in our Liberated Areas
even under war-time conditions. To sum up, we rely entirely on our own efforts,
and our position is invincible; this is the very opposite of Chiang Kai-shek
who depends entirely on foreign countries. We live plainly and work hard,
we take care of the needs of both the army and the people; this is the very
opposite of the situation in Chiang Kai-shek's areas, where those at the
top are corrupt and degenerate, while the people under them are destitute.
Under these circumstances, we shall surely be victorious.
<P>
6. Difficulties lie ahead of us but they can and must be overcome. All Party
comrades and all the troops and people in the Liberated Areas must unite
as one, completely smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and build an independent,
peaceful and democratic new China.

<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm1">l.</A> The "truce agreement" was the agreement concluded on
January 10, 1946 between representatives of the Communist Party of China
and Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang government. It stipulated that the troops
of both parties should cease military operations from their respective positions
as of midnight, January 13. But in fact Chiang Kai-shek used this agreement
as a smoke-screen behind which he made arrangements for a major war; at the
very time the cease-fire order was being transmitted, he ordered the Kuomintang
troops "to seize strategic points" and from then on moved up troops continuously
to attack the Liberated Areas. By July Chiang Kai-shek had openly torn up
the truce agreement and launched an all-out offensive against the Liberated
Areas. 
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm2">2.</A> The Political Consultative Conference was attended by
representatives of the Kuomintang, the Communist Party of China and other
political parties, and by personages without party affiliation and was held
in Chungking from January 10 to 31, 1946. The Conference adopted five
agreements<B>: </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  (1) Agreement on Government Organization. This agreement affirmed that "the
  Organic Law of the National Government shall be revised with a view to
  strengthening the National Government Council". It increased the number of
  National Government Councillors and provided that "the National Government
  Councillors shall be chosen by the President of the National Government from
  both Kuomintang and non-Kuomintang members"; that "the appointment of members
  of various parties as National Government Councillors by the President of
  the National Government shall be made on the recommendation of the parties
  concerned, which, in case of the President's disapproval, shall make new
  recommendations"; that "when the President of the National Government nominates
  as Government Councillor any personage without party affiliation, whose
  appointment is opposed by one-third of the Councillors already appointed,
  the President must reconsider the matter and make a new nomination for
  appointment"; and that "half the National Government Councillors shall be
  Kuomintang members and the other half members of other political parties
  and public personages". The National Government Council was nominally defined
  as "the supreme government organ in charge of state affairs", with powers
  to discuss and decide legislative principles, administrative polices and
  major military measures, financial plans and the budget as well as matters
  submitted by the President of the National Government for consideration;
  yet at the same time the President of the National Government was vested
  with great powers, including the power of nominating persons for office,
  the power of veto (which, though nominally limited was virtually absolute,
  for it required a majority of three-fifths to override a veto, while the
  President's own party, the Kuomintang, had half the seats) and emergency
  powers. The agreement also provided that "seven or eight members of the Executive
  Yuan shall be non-Kuomintang members who shall either hold the portfolios
  of existing ministries or hold the proposed posts of ministers of state without
  portfolio".

  to prescribing the principles governing the duties and powers of the National

  and that "military authority shall be separated from civil authority" and
  "no soldier in active service may serve concurrently as a civil official".
  With regard to the reorganization of the Kuomintang troops and the troops

  War into ninety divisions and this reorganization shall be completed at the
  highest possible speed within six months"; and that "when the above-mentioned
  two items of reorganization have been completed, all troops of the entire
  nation shall be unified and further reorganized into fifty or sixty divisions".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  These Political Consultative Conference agreements were, in varying degrees,
  favourable to the people and unfavourable to Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary
  rule. While expressing his approval of these agreements in an attempt to
  use them to carry out his peace fraud, Chiang Kai-shek actively made military
  preparations for launching a country-wide civil war. These Political Consultative
  Conference agreements were soon torn up by him one after another.
