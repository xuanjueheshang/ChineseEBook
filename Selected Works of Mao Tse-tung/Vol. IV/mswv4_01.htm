  THE SITUATION AND OUR POLICY AFTER THE VICTORY IN THE WAR OF RESISTANCE AGAINST
  JAPAN
</H1>
<p class="title">August 13, 1945</p>
<P class="information">
[This speech was delivered by Comrade Mao Tse-tung at a meeting of cadres
in Yenan. Based on the Marxist-Leninist method of class analysis, it presented
a penetrating study of the fundamental political situation in China after
victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan and set forth the revolutionary
tactics of the proletariat. As Comrade Mao Tse-tung had pointed out in his
opening address at the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of
China in April 1945, China after defeating Japanese imperialism still faced
two destinies, two futures -- either to become a new China or to remain the
old China. The big landlords and big bourgeoisie of China, represented by
Chiang Kai-shek, wanted to wrest the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance
from the hands of the people and to keep China a semi-colonial and semi-feudal
country under their dictatorship. The Communist Party of China, representing
the interests of the proletariat and the masses of the people, on the one
hand strove for peace and opposed civil war with all its strength. On the
other hand, it had to prepare fully against Chiang Kai-shek's
counter-revolutionary plot of launching a country-wide civil war and had
to adopt the correct policy, that is to say, to harbour no illusions about
imperialism and reaction, to have no fear of their threats, to resolutely
safeguard the fruits of the people's struggle and strive to build a new China
-- a new-democratic China of the broad masses of the people under the leadership
of the proletariat. The decisive struggle between the two destinies, the
two futures facing China, constituted the content of the historical period
from the conclusion of the War of Resistance Against Japan to the founding
of the People's Republic of China, the historical period of the Chinese People's
War of Liberation or Third Revolutionary Civil War. After the War of Resistance,
Chiang Kai-shek, supported by U.S. imperialism, tore up peace agreements
again and again and launched a gigantic counter-revolutionary civil war without
parallel in history in an attempt to wipe out the people's forces. Because
of the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China it took the Chinese
people only four years of struggle to win a great country-wide victory --
the overthrow of Chiang Kai-shek and the creation of a new China.]

  <hr class="end" />
<P>
These are days of tremendous change in the situation in the Far East. The
surrender of Japanese imperialism is now a foregone conclusion. The decisive
factor for Japan's surrender is the entry of the Soviet Union into the war.
A million Red Army troops are entering China's Northeast; this force is
irresistible. Japanese imperialism can no longer continue the
fight.<B>[<A href="#bm1">1</A>]</B> The Chinese people's hard and bitter
War of Resistance is crowned with victory. As a historical stage, the War
of Resistance Against Japan is now over. 
<p>
In these circumstances, what are the relations among the different classes
in China and what are the relations between the Kuomintang and the Communist
Party at present? What will they be like in the future? What is the policy
of our Party? These are questions of great concern to the people of the whole
country and to all members of our Party. 
<p>
What about the Kuomintang? Look at its past, and you can tell its present;
look at its past and present, and you can tell its future. In the past, this
party carried on a counter-revolutionary civil war for ten whole years. During
the War of Resistance it launched three large-scale anti-Communist campaigns,
<B>[<A href="#bm2">2</A>]</B> in 1940, 1941 and 1943, each time attempting
to develop the attack into a country-wide civil war. It was only because
of the correct policy adopted by our Party and the opposition of the people
of the whole country that its attempts failed. As everyone knows, Chiang
Kai-shek, the political representative of China's big landlords and big
bourgeoisie, is a most brutal and treacherous fellow. His policy has been
to look on with folded arms, wait for victory, conserve his forces and prepare
for civil war. Indeed, the victory he has been waiting for has arrived, and
now this "generalissimo" is about to "come down from the
mountain".<B>[<A href="#bm3">3</A>]</B> In the past eight years we have changed
places with Chiang Kai-shek -- formerly we were on the mountain and he was
by the water;<B>[<A href="#bm4">4</A>]</B> during the War of Resistance we
were behind the enemy lines and he went up the mountain. Now he is coming
down from the mountain, coming down to seize the fruits of victory.
<P>
During the past eight years the people and army of our Liberated Areas, receiving
no aid whatsoever from outside and relying solely on their own efforts, liberated
vast territories and resisted and pinned down the bulk of the Japanese invading
forces and practically all the puppet troops. Only by our determined resistance
and heroic struggle were the 200 million people in the Great Rear Area
<B>[<A href="#bm5">5</A>] </B>saved from being trampled underfoot by the
Japanese aggressors and the regions inhabited by these 200 million people
saved from Japanese occupation. Chiang Kai-shek hid on Mount Omei with guards
in front of him -- the guards were the Liberated Areas, the people and army
of the Liberated Areas. In defending the 200 million people of the Great
Rear Area, we protected this "generalissimo" as well and gave him both the
time and the space to sit around waiting for victory with folded arms. Time
-- eight years one month. Space -- an area inhabited by 200 million people.
These conditions we provided for him. But for us, he could not have stood
by looking on. Is the "generalissimo" grateful to us, then? No, not he! This
fellow has never known what it is to be grateful. How did Chiang Kai-shek
climb to power? By the Northern Expedition, <B>[<A href="#bm6">6</A>]</B>
by the first period of co-operation between the Kuomintang and the Communist
Party, <B>[<A href="#bm7">7</A>]</B> by the support given him by the people,
who had not yet seen through him. Once in power, Chiang Kai-shek, far from
being grateful to the people, knocked them down and plunged them into the
bloodbath of ten years of civil war. You comrades are familiar with this
segment of history. During the present War of Resistance the Chinese people
again defended him. This war is now ending in victory and Japan is on the
point of surrender, but he is not at all grateful to the people. On the contrary,
thumbing through the records of 1927, he wants to act in the same old
way.<B>[<A href="#bm8">8</A>]</B> He says there has never been any "civil
war" in China, only "bandit suppression". Whatever he likes to call it, the
fact is he wants to start a civil war against the people, he wants to slaughter
the people.
<P>
Until a civil war breaks out all over the country, many of the people and
many of our Party comrades will not have a very clear understanding of this
question. Since civil war is not yet here on a large scale, since it is not
yet widespread or out in the open and since the battles are not yet numerous,
many people think, "Well, there may not be a civil war after all!" Many others
are afraid of civil war. Their fear is not without reason. There were ten
years of fighting and then another eight years of the War of Resistance;
if the fighting keeps on, where will it all end? It is quite natural that
such fears should arise. With regard to Chiang Kai-shek's plot to launch
a civil war, our Party's policy has been clear and consistent, that is,
resolutely to oppose civil war, be against civil war and prevent civil war.
In the days to come, we shall continue, with the utmost effort and greatest
patience, to lead the people in preventing civil war. Nevertheless, it is
necessary to be soberly aware that the danger of civil war is extremely serious
because Chiang Kai-shek's policy is already set. Chiang Kai-shek's policy
is civil war. Our policy, the policy of the people, is against civil war.
The opponents of civil war consist only of the Chinese Communist Party and
the Chinese people -- it is a pity that they do not include Chiang Kai-shek
and the Kuomintang. Here one side does not want to fight and the other does.
If both did not want it, there would be no fighting. Now, since only one
side is against it and this side is not yet strong enough to check the other,
the danger of civil war is extremely grave.
<P>
Our Party pointed out in good time that Chiang Kai-shek would stick to his
reactionary policy of dictatorship and civil war. Before, during and after
the Seventh Party Congress, <B>[<A href="#bm9">9</A>]</B> we did fairly adequate
work to call the people's attention to the danger of civil war, so that the
whole people, our Party members and our troops should be mentally prepared
well in advance. This is a very important point, and it makes a world of
difference whether or not there is such preparedness. In 1927 our Party was
still in its infancy and was mentally wholly unprepared for Chiang Kai-shek's
counter-revolutionary surprise attack. Consequently the fruits of victory
won by the people were soon lost, the people had to undergo long suffering,
and a bright China was plunged into darkness. This time things are different,
our Party has acquired the rich experience of three revolutions
<B>[<A href="#bm10">10</A>]</B> and a much higher degree of political maturity.
Time and again, the Central Committee of the Party has clearly explained
the danger of civil war, and so the whole people, all Party members and the
troops led by our Party are in a state of preparedness.
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek always tries to wrest every ounce of power and every ounce
of gain from the people. And we? Our policy is to give him tit for tat and
to fight for every inch of land. We act after his fashion. He always tries
to impose war on the people, one sword in his left hand and another in his
right. We take up swords, too, following his example. We found this method
only after investigation and study. Such investigation and study are very
important. When we see the other fellow holding something in his hands, we
should do some investigating. What does he hold in his hands? Swords. What
are swords for? For killing. Whom does he want to kill with his swords? The
people. Having made these findings, investigate further -- the Chinese people,
too, have hands and can take up swords, they can forge a sword if there is
none handy. The Chinese people have discovered this truth after long
investigation and study. Warlords, landlords, local bullies and bad gentry
and the imperialists all have swords in their hands and are out to kill.
The people have come to understand this and so act after the same fashion.
Some of us often neglect such investigation and study. Chen Tu-hsiu,
<B>[<A href="#bm11">11</A>]</B> for example, did not understand that with
swords one can kill people. Some say, this is a plain everyday truth; how
can a leader of the Communist Party fail to know it? But you never can tell.
Chen Tu-hsiu made no investigation and study and so did not understand this,
hence we called him an opportunist. He who makes no investigation and study
has no right to speak, and accordingly we deprived Chen Tu-hsiu of that right.
We have adopted a course different from Chen Tu-hsiu's and enabled the people
suffering from oppression and slaughter to take up swords. If ever again
anybody wants to kill us, we will act after his fashion. Not long ago, the
Kuomintang sent six divisions to attack our Kuanchung sub-region, and three
of them drove in and seized an area measuring 20 by 100<EM> li</EM>. We acted
after their fashion and wholly, thoroughly and completely wiped out the
Kuomintang troops in this area of 20 by 100
<EM>li.</EM>[<A href="#bm12">12</A>]<EM> </EM>Our policy is to give tit for
tat and fight for every inch of land; we will never let the Kuomintang easily
seize our land and kill our people. Of course, to fight for every inch of
land does not mean following the old "Left" line of "not abandoning a single
inch of land in the base area".<B>[<A href="#bm13">13</A>] </B>This time
we abandoned an area of 20 by 100 <EM>li</EM>. Abandoned late in July, it
was retaken early in August. After the Southern Anhwei Incident of 1941<B>,
[<A href="#bm14">14</A>]</B> the Kuomintang liaison staff officer once asked
me what we intended to do. I answered, "You are here in Yenan all the time
and you don't know? If Ho goes for us, we'll go for him. If Ho stops, we'll
stop too."<B>[<A href="#bm15">15</A>]</B> At that time Chiang Kai-shek was
not named, only Ho Ying-chin. Today we say, "If Chiang goes for us, we'll
go for him. If Chiang stops, we'll stop too." We will act after his fashion.
As Chiang Kai-shek is now sharpening his swords, we must sharpen ours too.
<P>
The rights the people have won must never be lightly given up but must be
defended by fighting. We don't want civil war. However, if Chiang Kai-shek
insists on forcing civil war on the Chinese people, the only thing we can
do is to take up arms and fight him in self-defence to protect the lives
and property, the rights and well-being of the people of the Liberated Areas.
This will be a civil war he forces on us. If we do not win, we will blame
neither heaven nor earth but only ourselves. However, let no one think that
the people can be easily robbed or defrauded of the rights they have won;
that is impossible. Last year an American correspondent asked me, "Who has
given you the power to act?" I replied, "The people." Who else indeed, if
not the people? The ruling Kuomintang hasn't given us any power. It doesn't
recognize us. We take part in the People's Political Council in the capacity
of a "cultural organization" <B>[<A href="#bm16">16</A>]</B> as stipulated
by its rules. But we are not a "cultural organization", we say, we have an
army and are a "military organization". On March 1 this year Chiang Kai-shek
stated that the Communist Party would have to turn over its army before it
could acquire legal status. Chiang Kai-shek's statement still stands. We
have not turned over our army, and so we have no legal status and are "defying
laws human and divine". Our duty is to hold ourselves responsible to the
people. Every word, every act and every policy must conform to the people's
interests, and if mistakes occur, they must be corrected -- that is what
being responsible to the people means. Comrades! The people want liberation
and therefore entrust power to those who can represent them and work faithfully
for them, that is, to us Communists. As representatives of the people, we
must represent them well and not act like Chen Tu-hsiu. Confronted by
counter-revolutionary attacks against the people, Chen Tu-hsiu did not adopt
the policy of giving tit for tat and fighting for every inch of land; as
a result, in 1927, within the space of a few months, he forfeited all the
rights the people had won. This time we must be on our guard. Our policy
is absolutely different from Chen Tu-hsiu's; no trickery can fool us. We
must be clearheaded and have a correct policy; we must not make mistakes.
<P>
To whom should the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance belong? It
is very obvious. Take a peach tree for example. When the tree yields peaches
they are the fruits of victory. Who is entitled to pick the peaches? Ask
who planted and watered the tree. Chiang Kai-shek squatting on the mountain
did not carry a single bucket of water, and yet he is now stretching out
his arm from afar to pick the peaches. "I, Chiang Kai-shek, own these peaches,"
he says, "I am the landlord, you are my serfs and I won't allow you to pick
any." We have refuted him in the press<B>. [<A href="#bm17">17</A>]</B> We
say, "You never carried any water, so you have no right to pick the peaches.
We the people of the Liberated Areas watered the tree day in day out and
have the most right to gather the fruit." Comrades! The victory of the War
of Resistance has been won by the people with bloodshed and sacrifice, it
should be the victory of the people and it is to the people that the fruits
of the War of Resistance should go. As for Chiang Kai-shek, he was passive
in resisting Japan but active in anti-communism. He was a stumbling-block
in the people's War of Resistance. Now this stumbling-block is coming forward
to monopolize the fruits of victory, wants China after victory to relapse
into her old pre-war state and does not tolerate the slightest change. This
gives rise to struggle. Comrades! It is a most serious struggle.
<P>
That the fruits of victory of the War of Resistance should go to the people
is one thing, but who will eventually get them and whether it will be the
people is another. Don't be too sure that all the fruits of victory will
fall into the hands of the people. Chiang Kai-shek will grab a lot of big
peaches, such as Shanghai, Nanking, Hangchow and other big cities. He has
ganged up with U.S. imperialism and in those places they have the upper hand,
while so far the revolutionary people can by and large occupy only the rural
areas. Another bunch of peaches will be contested by both sides. These are
the medium and small towns situated along the section of the Tatung-Puchow
Railway north of Taiyuan, the middle section of the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway,
the Peiping-Liaoning Railway, the section of the Peiping-Hankow Railway north
of Chengchow, the Chengting-Taiyuan Railway, the Paikuei-Chincheng Railway,
<B>[<A href="#bm18">18</A>]</B> the Tehchow-Shihchiachuang Railway, the
Tientsin-Pukow Railway, the Tsingtao-Tsinan Railway and the section of the
Lunghai Railway east of Chengchow. These medium and small towns must be
contested; they are the medium and small peaches watered by the people of
the Liberated Areas with their sweat and blood. It is difficult to say now
whether these places will fall into the people's hands. Only two words can
be said now: struggle hard. Are there places which are sure to fall into
the hands of the people? Yes, there are. They are the vast rural areas and
the numerous towns in the provinces of Hopei, Chahar and Jehol,
<B>[<A href="#bm19">19</A>]</B> most of Shansi, Shantung and the northern
part of Kiangsu, with villages linked together and with about a hundred towns
in one area, seventy to eighty in another, forty to fifty in a third --
altogether three, four, five or six such areas, big and small. What sort
of towns? Medium and small towns. We are sure of them, we have the strength
to pick these fruits of victory. In the history of the Chinese revolution
this will be the first time that we have got such a bunch of fruit. Historically,
it was only after we smashed the enemy's third "encirclement and suppression"
campaign <B>[<A href="#bm20">20</A>]</B> in the latter half of 1931 that
we had altogether as many as twenty-one county towns
<B>[<A href="#bm21">21</A>]</B> in the Central Base Area in Kiangsi Province,
but there was not a single medium-sized town among them. With twenty-one
small towns linked together, the total population at its height reached
2,500,000. Relying on this base, the Chinese people were able to continue
the struggle for such a long time, win such big victories and smash such
big "encirclement and suppression" campaigns. Later we were defeated, for
which we should blame, not Chiang Kai-shek, but ourselves for not fighting
well enough. This time, if scores of big and small towns are linked in a
single contiguous area and if there are three, four, five or six such areas,
then the Chinese people will have three, four, five or six revolutionary
bases, each larger than the Central Base Area in Kiangsi Province, and the
situation for the Chinese revolution will be very promising indeed.
<P>
If one looks at the situation as a whole, the stage of the War of Resistance
Against Japan is over and the new situation and task is domestic struggle.
Chiang Kai-shek talks about "building the country". From now on the struggle
will be, build what sort of country? To build a new-democratic country of
the broad masses of the people under the leadership of the proletariat? Or
to build a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country under the dictatorship of
the big landlords and the big bourgeoisie? This will be a most complicated
struggle. At present it takes the form of a struggle between Chiang Kai-shek
who is trying to usurp the fruits of victory of the War of Resistance and
ourselves who oppose his usurpation. If there is any opportunism during this
period, it will lie in failing to struggle hard and in making a voluntary
gift to Chiang Kai-shek of the fruits which should go to the people.
<P>
Will an open and total civil war break out? That depends on internal and
international factors. The internal factors consist chiefly of our strength
and the degree of our political consciousness. Given the general trend of
the international and internal situation and the feelings of the people,
is it possible, through our own struggles, to localize the civil war or delay
the outbreak of a country-wide civil war? There is this possibility.
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek will face many difficulties if he tries to let loose a civil
war. First, in the Liberated Areas there are a hundred million people, a
million troops and over two million people's militia. Second, the politically
conscious people in the Kuomintang areas are against civil war, and this
is some kind of check on Chiang Kai-shek. Third, inside the Kuomintang also
there is a section which is not in favour of civil war. The situation today
is vastly different from that in 1927. In particular, the condition of our
Party today is vastly different from what it was in 1927. In those days our
Party was still in its infancy and did not have a clear head or experience
in armed struggle or the policy of giving tit for tat. Today the level of
political consciousness in our Party is very much higher.
<P>
Apart from our own political consciousness, the political consciousness of
the vanguard of the proletariat, there is the question of the political
consciousness of the masses of the people. When the people are not yet
politically conscious, it is entirely possible that their revolutionary gains
may be handed over to others. This happened in the past. Today the level
of political consciousness of the Chinese people is likewise very much higher.
The prestige of our Party among the people has never been so great. Nevertheless,
among the people, and chiefly among those living in the Japanese-occupied
and Kuomintang areas, there are still a good many who believe in Chiang Kai-shek
and have illusions about the Kuomintang and the United States of America,
illusions which Chiang Kai-shek is working hard to spread. The fact that
a section of the Chinese people is not yet politically conscious shows that
much remains to be done in our propaganda and organizational work. The political
awakening of the people is not easy. It requires much earnest effort on our
part to rid their minds of wrong ideas. We should sweep backward ideas from
the minds of the Chinese people, just as we sweep our rooms. Dust never vanishes
of itself without sweeping. We must carry on extensive propaganda and education
among the masses, so they will understand the real situation and trend in
China and have confidence in their own strength.
<P>
It is up to us to organize the people. As for the reactionaries in China,
it is up to us to organize the people to overthrow them. Everything reactionary
is the same; if you don't hit it, it won't fall. It is like sweeping the
floor; where the broom does not reach, the dust never vanishes of itself.
There is a river called the Chieh-tse, south of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia
Border Region. South of the river is Lochuan County and north of it, Fuhsien
County. North and south of the river are two different worlds. The south
is under the Kuomintang; since we have not reached there, the people are
unorganized, and there is much filth and rottenness. Some of our comrades
put their faith only in political influence, fancying that problems can be
solved merely by influence. That is blind faith. In 1936, we were in Pao-an.
<B>[<A href="#bm22">22</A>] </B>Forty to fifty <EM>li</EM> away, there was
a fortified village held by a landlord despot. The Central Committee of the
Party was then in Pao-an and our political influence could be considered
very great indeed, but the counter-revolutionaries in this village obstinately
refused to surrender. We swept to the south, we swept to the north, all in
vain. Not until our broom swept right into the village did the landlord cry
out, "Ow, I give up!" <B>[<A href="#bm23">23</A>]</B> That is how things
are in this world. Bells don't ring till you strike them. Tables don't move
till you shift them. Japan would not surrender until after the Red Army of
the Soviet Union entered northeastern China. The enemy and puppet troops
never handed over their arms until our troops fought them. Only where the
broom reaches can political influence produce its full effect. Our broom
is the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. Broom
in hand, you must learn to sweep; don't lie in bed, fancying that a gust
of wind will somehow rise and blow all the dust away. We Marxists are
revolutionary realists and never indulge in idle dreams. There is an old
saying in China, "Rise at dawn and sweep the courtyard."
<B>[<A href="#bm24">24</A>]</B> Dawn is the breaking of a new day. Our
forefathers told us to rise and start sweeping at the very break of day.
They were setting us a task. Only by thinking and acting in this way will
we benefit and find work to do. China has a vast territory, and it is up
to us to sweep it clean inch by inch.
<P>
On what basis should our policy rest? It should rest on our own strength,
and that means regeneration through one's own efforts. We are not alone;
all the countries and people in the world opposed to imperialism are our
friends. Nevertheless, we stress regeneration through our own efforts. Relying
on the forces we ourselves organize, we can defeat all Chinese and foreign
reactionaries. Chiang Kai-shek, on the contrary, relies entirely on the aid
of U.S. imperialism, which he looks upon as his mainstay. The trinity of
dictatorship, civil war and selling out the country has always been the basis
of his policy. U.S. imperialism wants to help Chiang Kai-shek wage civil
war and turn China into a U.S. dependency, and this policy, too, was set
long ago. But U.S. imperialism while outwardly strong is inwardly weak. We
must be clear-headed, that is, we must not believe the "nice words" of the
imperialists nor be intimidated by their bluster. An American once said to
me, "You should listen to Hurley and send a few men to be officials in the
Kuomintang government."<B>[<A href="#bm25">25</A>]</B> I replied: "It is
no easy job to be an official bound hand and foot; we won't do it. If we
become officials, our hands and feet must be unfettered, we must be free
to act, that is, a coalition government must be set up on a democratic basis."
He said, "It will be bad if you don't." I asked him, "Why bad?" He said,
"First, the Americans will curse you; secondly, the Americans will back Chiang
Kai-shek." I replied: "If you Americans, sated with bread and sleep, want
to curse people and back Chiang Kai-shek, that's your business and I won't
interfere. What we have now is millet plus rifles, what you have is bread
plus cannon. If you like to back Chiang Kai-shek, back him, back him as long
as you want. But remember one thing. To whom does China belong? China definitely
does not belong to Chiang Kai-shek, China belongs to the Chinese people.
The day will surely come when you will find it impossible to back him any
longer." Comrades! This American was trying to scare people. Imperialists
are masters at this sort of stuff, and many people in the colonial countries
do get scared. The imperialists think that all people in the colonial countries
can be scared, but they do not realize that in China there are people who
are not afraid of that sort of stuff. In the past we have openly criticized
and exposed the U.S. policy of aiding Chiang Kai-shek to fight the Communists;
it was necessary, and we shall continue to do so.
<P>
The Soviet Union has sent its troops, the Red Army has come to help the Chinese
people drive out the aggressor; such an event has never happened before in
Chinese history. Its influence is immeasurable. The propaganda organs of
the United States and Chiang Kai-shek hoped to sweep away the Red Army's
political influence with two atom bombs.<B>[<A href="#bm26">26</A>]</B> But
it can't be swept away; that isn't so easy. Can atom bombs decide wars? No,
they can't. Atom bombs could not make Japan surrender. Without the struggles
waged by the people, atom bombs by themselves would be of no avail. If atom
bombs could decide the war, then why was it necessary to ask the Soviet Union
to send its troops? Why didn't Japan surrender when the two atom bombs were
dropped on her and why did she surrender as soon as the Soviet Union sent
troops? Some of our comrades, too, believe that the atom bomb is all-powerful;
that is a big mistake. These comrades show even less judgement than a British
peer. There is a certain British peer called Lord Mountbatten. He said the
worst possible mistake is to think that the atom bomb can decide the
war.<B>[<A href="#bm27">27</A>]</B> These comrades are more backward than
Mountbatten. What influence has made these comrades look upon the atom bomb
as something miraculous? Bourgeois influence. Where does it come from? From
their education in bourgeois schools, from the bourgeois press and news agencies.
There are two world outlooks and two methodologies, the proletarian world
outlook and methodology and the bourgeois world outlook and methodology.
These comrades often cling to the bourgeois world outlook and methodology
and often forget the proletarian world outlook and methodology. The theory
that "weapons decide everything", the purely military viewpoint, a bureaucratic
style of work divorced from the masses, individualist thinking, and the like
-- all these are bourgeois influences in our ranks. We must constantly sweep
these bourgeois things out of our ranks just as we sweep out dust.
<P>
The entry of the Soviet Union into the war has decided Japan's surrender
and the situation in China is entering a new period. Between the War of
Resistance and the new period there is a transitional stage. The struggle
during this transitional stage is to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's usurpation
of the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance. Chiang Kai-shek wants
to launch a country-wide civil war and his policy is set; we must be prepared
for this. No matter when this country-wide civil war breaks out, we must
be well prepared. If it comes early, say, tomorrow morning, we should also
be prepared. That is point one. In the present international and domestic
situation it is possible that for a time the civil war may be kept restricted
in scale and localized. That is point two. Point one is what we should prepare
for, point two is what has existed for a long time. In short, we must be
prepared. Being prepared, we shall be able to deal properly with all kinds
of complicated situations.</p>

<p class="information"><A name="bm1">1</A>. On August 8, 1945, the Soviet government declared war
on Japan. On August 10 the Mongolian government declared war on Japan. The
Soviet Red Army moved by land and sea into China's Northeast and into Korea
and swiftly routed the Japanese Kwantung Army. The joint Soviet-Mongolian
armies crossed the Inner Mongolian desert and entered Jehol and Chahar Provinces.
On August 10 the Japanese government was compelled to send a note begging
to surrender and on the 14th it formally announced its unconditional surrender.
The Kwantung Army was the cream of the main force of the Japanese army and
constituted Japan's general strategic reserve. The Japanese imperialists
had dreamed of relying on this force to carry on a long-drawn-out war from
their favourable strategic position in China's Northeast and in Korea. This
scheme was completely wrecked by the entry of the Soviet Union into the war,
and the Japanese government had to admit defeat and surrender.

Session of the Kuomintang's Central Executive Committee and the Second Session

<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm3">3</A>. "Mountain" here refers to Mount Omei in Szechuan Province
and more generally to the mountainous areas in southwestern and northwestern
China. After Wuhan was occupied by the Japanese army in 1938, Chiang Kai-shek
and the main force under his command took refuge in these mountainous areas
and sat there watching the bitter struggle against the Japanese aggressors
which was being waged behind the enemy lines by the army and people of the
Liberated Areas.
<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm4">4</A>. Prior to the War of Resistance Against Japan, most of
the revolutionary base areas led by the Communist Party of China were in
mountainous regions. At that time Chiang Kai-shek's rule was centred in the
large cities along the big rivers and the coast. Accordingly, Comrade Mao
Tse-tung said "we were on the mountain and he was by the water".
<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm5">5</A>. During the War of Resistance the front lines were in
northern, eastern, central and southern China. People usually referred to
the Kuomintang areas in southwestern and northwestern China which were not
occupied by the Japanese invaders as the Great Rear Area.
<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm6">6</A>. The Northern Expedition was the punitive war against
the Northern warlords launched by the revolutionary army which marched north
from Kwangtung Province in May-July 1926. The Northern Expeditionary Army,
with the Communist Party of China taking part in its leadership and under
the Party's influence (the political work in the army was at that time mostly
under the charge of Communist Party members), gained the warm support of
the broad masses of workers and peasants. In the second half of 1926 and
the first half of 1927 it occupied most of the provinces along the Yangtse
and Yellow Rivers and defeated the Northern warlords. In April 1927 this
revolutionary war failed as a result of betrayal by the reactionary clique
under Chiang Kai-shek within the army.
<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm7">7</A>. In 1924, with the help of the Communist Party of China,
Sun Yat-sen reorganized the Kuomintang and effected co-operation between
the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The Revolutionary War of 1924-27
was launched on the basis of this cooperation. This first co-operation between
the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was wrecked as a result of betrayals
by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei in 1927.
<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm8">8</A>. This refers to Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution
in 1927. After betraying the revolution, Chiang Kai-shek massacred great
numbers of Communists workers, peasants and revolutionary intellectuals and
unleashed a counter-revolutionary war against the revolutionary masses.
<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm9">9</A>. This Congress was held in Yenan in April 1945. It was
there that Comrade Mao Tse-tung delivered the political report "On Coalition
Government" (see <EM>Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, </EM>Vol. III).
<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm10">10</A>. The first revolution was the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal
revolutionary struggle waged from 1924 to 1927 by the Chinese people under
the leadership of the Communist Party of China; the Northern Expedition was
the main content of this revolution. The second revolution was the revolutionary
struggle from 1927 to 1937 to create and develop Red political power. The
third revolution was the War of Resistance Against Japan from 1937 to 1945.
<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm11">11</A>. Chen Tu-hsiu was originally a professor at Peking
University and became famous as an editor of <EM>New Youth. </EM>He was one
of the founders of the Communist Party of China. Owing to his reputation
at the time of the May 4th Movement and owing to the Party's immaturity in
its initial period, he became General Secretary of the Party. In the last
period of the revolution of 1924-27, the Rightist thinking in the Party
represented by Chen Tu-hsiu developed into a line of capitulationism. In
"The Present Situation and Our Tasks", Comrade Mao Tse-tung said that the
capitulationists at that time "voluntarily gave up the Party's leadership
of the peasant masses, urban petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie, and
in particular gave up the Party's leadership of the armed forces, thus causing
the defeat of the revolution" (p. 171 of this volume). After the defeat in
1927 Chen Tu-hsiu and a handful of other capitulationists lost faith in the
future of the revolution and became liquidationists. They took the reactionary
Trotskyist stand and together with the Trotskyites formed a small anti-Party
group. Consequently Chen Tu-hsiu was expelled from the Party in November
1929. He died in 1942. With reference to Chen Tu-hsiu's Right opportunism,
see the introductory notes to "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society"
and to "Report on the Investigation into the Peasant Movement in Hunan",
<EM>Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, </EM>Vol. I, and "Introducing <EM>The
Communist", Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, </EM>Vol. II.

<p class="information"><A name="bm12">12</A>. On July 21, 1945, the Provisional 59th Division and
2nd Cavalry Division under Hu Tsung-nan, Commander of the Kuomintang's 1st
War Zone, suddenly attacked Yehtai Mountain in Chunhua County in the Kuanchung
sub-region of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. On July 23 Hu Tsung-nan
sent his 3rd Reserve Division to join in the attack. On July 27 our forces
withdrew on their own initiative from Yehtai Mountain and forty-one villages
west of it. The Kuomintang forces continued their attacks on Hsunyi, Yaohsien
and other points. On August 8 our forces struck back at the invading Kuomintang
troops and recovered the Yehtai mountain area.
<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm13">13</A>. This slogan was raised by the "Left" opportunists
during the period from October 1933 to October 1934 when the Red Army of
the Central Base Area was repulsing the Kuomintang's fifth encirclement campaign.
The slogan was diametrically opposed to the strategy formulated by Comrade
Mao Tse-tung, which was to lure the enemy deep into our territory, concentrate
a superior force and select the enemy's weak points in order to wipe him
out in mobile warfare.
<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm14">14</A>. In January 1941, as demanded by Chiang Kai-shek, the
Headquarters of the New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party of China and
the units under the direct command of this headquarters moved north from
southern Anhwei Province to cross the Yangtse River. While on the march they
were encircled and ambushed by Chiang Kai-shek's troops and lost more than
9,000, killed, wounded and captured. Chiang Kai-shek announced the cancellation
of the designation of the New Fourth Army and ordered attacks against its
other units. The event was called the Southern Anhwei Incident.
<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm15">15</A>. During the War of Resistance the Kuomintang kept a
staff officer in Yenan for liaison. "Ho" refers to Ho Ying-chin, Chief of
the Kuomintang General Staff. On October 19 and December 8,1940, Chiang Kai-shek
sent two telegrams in the names of Ho Ying-chin and Pai Chung-hsi, Deputy
Chief of the Kuomintang General Staff, outrageously slandering the Eighth
Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which were fighting stubbornly behind
the Japanese lines, and arbitrarily ordering the people's anti-Japanese armed
forces operating south of the Yellow River to withdraw north of the river
within a definite time-limit. The Kuomintang reactionaries then launched
a sudden attack on units of the New Fourth Army which were moving north and
thus created the Southern Anhwei Incident. At that time the Communist Party
of China pointed to Ho Ying-chin as the representative of the Kuomintang
reactionaries who had launched the large-scale anti-Communist campaign, but
actually Chiang Kai-shek was meant.
<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm16">16</A>. The "People's Political Council" was an advisory body
set up by the Kuomintang government after the start of the War of Resistance.
Its members were all "selected" by the Kuomintang government; the majority
belonged to the Kuomintang, and only a very few belonged to the Communist
Party of China and other political parties. Moreover, the Kuomintang government
did not recognize the equal and legal status of the parties which were opposed
to Japanese aggression, nor did it allow their members to sit in the "People's
Political Council" as representatives of their parties. One of the stipulations
of the "Organic Rules of the People's Political Council" promulgated by the
Kuomintang government was that those persons might become members of the
Council "who have served in important cultural or economic organizations
for three years or more and enjoy prestige, or those who devote themselves
to affairs of state and have long enjoyed prestige". It was on the basis
of this stipulation that the Kuomintang "selected" some counselors from the
Communist Party of China.

<p class="information"><A name="bm20">20</A>. From July to September 1931 Chiang Kai-shek personally
held the post of commander-in-chief and moved 300,000 reactionary troops
in an encirclement campaign against the Kiangsi Red Base Area. The Red Army
smashed this encirclement campaign and won a great victory. For details,
see "Strategic Problems of the Chinese Revolutionary War", Chapter 5, Section
5,<EM> Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, </EM>Vol. I.

<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm22">22</A>. Pao-an was a county in the northwestern part of Shensi
Province. It is now called Chihtan County. The Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China had its headquarters there from early July 1936 to January
1937. Later it moved to Yenan.
<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm23">23</A>. The fortified village referred to was Tanpachai in
the southwest of Pao-an County. There were over two hundred households in
the village, which occupied a highly strategic position. Tsao Chun-chang,
a landlord despot who headed a reactionary local armed band of over a hundred
men, had long entrenched himself in this village. The Chinese Red Army repeatedly
besieged the village but failed to capture it. In August 1936 the Red Army,
while surrounding Tanpachai with the local armed forces, proceeded to win
over the basic masses in the village and disintegrate the enemy from within.
In December of the same year the bandit Tsao fled with a handful of his men,
and Tanpachai was liberated.

head of the U.S. Army Observer Group in Yenan. With the consent of the Communist
Party of China, this group was sent to Yenan in 1944 by the U.S. forces fighting
against Japan. Patrick J. Hurley, a reactionary politician of the Republican
Party, came to China in September 1944 as the personal representative of
the U.S. president and at the end of the year became U.S. ambassador to China.

<p class="information"><A name="bm26">26</A>. The United States dropped an atom bomb on Hiroshima
on August 6, 1945, and another on Nagasaki on August 9. The propaganda organs
of the United States and of the Kuomintang made much of the event, alleging
that the Japanese government had surrendered because it was afraid of the
U.S. atom bombs. By such propaganda they hoped to belittle the decisive role
played by the entry of the Soviet Union into the war in compelling Japan
to surrender.
<P>
<p class="information"><A name="bm27">27</A>. Mountbatten, then Supreme Commander of Allied Forces
in Southeast Asia, made a statement on August 9, 1945, welcoming the entry
of the Soviet Union into the war against Japan. He also said that the worst
possible mistake would be to believe that the atom bomb could end the war
in the Far East.
