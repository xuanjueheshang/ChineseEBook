  ON THE WAR CRIMINAL'S SUING FOR PEACE
</H1>
<p class="title">
<EM>January 5, 1949</EM>
<P class="information">
[This commentary was the first of a series written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung
for the Hsinhua News Agency to expose the Kuomintang's use of peace negotiations
in order to preserve the counter-revolutionary forces. Other commentaries
in the series included "Why Do the Badly Split Reactionaries Still Idly Clamour
for 'Total Peace'?", "The Kuomintang Reactionaries Turn from an 'Appeal for
Peace' to an Appeal for War", "On the Kuomintang's Different Answers to the
Question of Responsibility for the War" and "Whither the Nanking Government?"

<P>
In order to preserve the forces of Chinese reaction and U.S. aggression in
China, Chiang Kai-shek, China's No. 1<EM> </EM>war criminal and chieftain
of the Kuomintang bandit gang, issued a statement on New Year's Day suing
for peace. The war criminal Chiang Kai-shek says<B>: </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  I have no desire of my own other than that the peace negotiations should
  not impair the country's independence and integrity but instead should help
  the rehabilitation of the people; that the sacred constitution should not
  be violated by my action and that democratic constitutionalism should not
  be thereby undermined; that the form of government of the Republic of China
  should be guaranteed and the legally constituted authority of the Republic
  of China should not be interrupted; that the armed forces should be definitely
  preserved and that the people should be allowed to continue their free way
  of life and maintain their present minimum standard of living.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  . . . If only peace can be realized, I certainly do not care whether I remain
  in office or retire, but will abide by the common will of the people.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
People should not think that there is something ridiculous about a war criminal
suing for peace, nor should they think that such a bid for peace is really
disgusting. It should be understood that for the No. 1<EM> </EM>war criminal
and chieftain of the Kuomintang bandit gang to sue personally for peace and
issue such a statement is obviously of some benefit to the Chinese people,
because it enables them to see through the plots of the Kuomintang bandit
gang and the U.S. imperialists. For the Chinese people can tell from this
that the "peace" about which there has lately been so much clamour is exactly
what this Chiang Kai-shek gang of murderers and their U.S. master urgently
need.
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek has confessed the gang's whole plot. The main points of this
plot are as follows<B>: </B>
<P>
"The peace negotiations should not impair the country's independence and
integrity" -- this is first in importance. "Peace" is all right, but "peace"
is a million times wrong if it impairs the "independence and integrity" of
the state of the four big families and the comprador and landlord classes.
"Peace" is absolutely all wrong if it impairs such treaties as the Sino-U.S.
Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, the Sino-U.S. Air Transport
Agreement<B> [<A href="#bm1">1</A>]</B> and the Sino-U.S. bilateral agreement,
<B>[<A href="#bm2">2</A>]</B> or if it impairs such prerogatives enjoyed
by the United States in China as the stationing of ground, naval and air
forces, the building of military bases, the exploitation of mines and the
monopoly of trade, or if it interferes with China's becoming a U.S. colony
-- in short, if it impairs any such measures as protect the "independence
and integrity" of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary state.
<P>
"Help the rehabilitation of the people" -- that is, "peace" must help the
rehabilitation of the Chinese reactionaries, who have been defeated but not
yet wiped out, so that, once rehabilitated, they can stage a comeback and
extinguish the revolution. This is exactly what "peace" is for. The war has
been going on for two and a half years, "the running dog can no longer run"
and the Americans are angry; a rest-cure, however brief, is better than none.
<P>
"The sacred constitution should not be violated by my action and democratic
constitutionalism should not be thereby undermined; the form of government
of the Republic of China should be guaranteed and the legally constituted
authority of the Republic of China should not be interrupted" -- all this
means guaranteeing the ruling position of China's reactionary classes and
reactionary government and guaranteeing that the "legally constituted authority"
of these classes and their government will not be "interrupted". This "legally
constituted authority" certainly must not be "interrupted", for to "interrupt"
it would be very dangerous -- it would mean the finish of the whole of the
comprador and landlord classes, the end of the Kuomintang gang of bandits
and the arrest and punishment of all the war criminals, big, medium and small.
<P>
"The armed forces should be definitely preserved" -- they are the lifeline
of the comprador and landlord classes, and although several millions have
been wiped out by the detested People's Liberation Army, there still remain
one million several hundred thousand troops which must be "preserved", and
"definitely" so. If they were "preserved", but not "definitely", the comprador
and landlord classes would lose their capital, their "legally constituted
authority" would still be "interrupted", the Kuomintang bandit gang would
still be finished, all the war criminals, big, medium and small, would still
be arrested and punished. Just as the life of Chia Pao-yu of the Grand View
Garden depended upon a piece of jade in his
necklace,<B>[<A href="#bm3">3</A>]</B> the life of the Kuomintang depends
upon its army, so how can one say that its army should not be "preserved",
or should only be "preserved" but not "definitely" so?
<P>
"The people should be allowed to continue their free way of life and maintain
their present minimum standard of living" -- this means the Chinese comprador
and landlord classes must preserve their freedom to oppress and exploit the
people of the whole country and their freedom to maintain their present standard
of lordly, luxurious, loose and idle living, while the Chinese working people
must preserve their freedom to be oppressed and exploited and maintain their
present standard of living, a life of cold and hunger. That is the ultimate
aim of the war criminals in suing for peace. What is the use of peace, if
the war criminals and the classes to which they belong cannot preserve their
freedom to oppress and exploit and cannot maintain their standard of lordly,
luxurious, loose and idle living? To preserve all this, it is of course necessary
for the workers, peasants, intellectuals, government employees and teachers
to maintain their present "free way of life and minimum standard of living",
a life of cold and hunger. Once our beloved President Chiang puts forward
this condition, the tens of millions of workers, handicraftsmen and
professionals, the hundreds of millions of peasants, and the millions of
intellectuals, government employees and teachers can only clap their hands
in unison, prostrate themselves and shout, "Long live the President!" If
the Communist Party still refuses peace, so that this wonderful way of life
and standard of living cannot be maintained, then it will be guilty of a
crime for which it deserves to die ten thousand deaths, and "the Communist
Party will be held responsible for all the consequences".
<P>
In saying all this, however, we have not exhausted the whole treasury of
wonderful ideas in the war criminal's statement of January 1 suing for peace.
Here is another gem -- what Chiang Kai-shek in his New Year message calls
"a decisive battle in the Nanking-Shanghai sector". Where is the strength
for such a "decisive battle"? Chiang Kai-shek says, "It must be understood
that today the strength of the government in the military, political, economic
or any other field is several times or even tens of times greater than that
of the Communist Party." Oh! Ho! How can people not be scared to death by
such immense strength? Leaving political and economic strength aside and
taking only military strength, one sees that the People's Liberation Army
now has over three million men, that two times "greater" than this number
is over six million and that ten times "greater" is over thirty million.
And how many will "tens of times" be? All right, let's take twenty times,
which gives over sixty million men; no wonder President Chiang says he has
"full confidence in winning the decisive battle". Why then should he beg
for peace? Certainly not because he can no longer fight. For if he were to
bring the pressure of over sixty million troops to bear, could there be any
chance of survival for the Communist Party or any other party in the world?
All of course would be crushed to powder. It is clear then that when he begs
for peace, it is certainly for no other reason than "to plead for the life
of the people".
<P>
But is everything going well, without any hitch? There is a hitch, it is
said. What is the hitch? President Chiang says<B>:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  It is regrettable that there are people in our government who have come under
  the influence of malicious Communist propaganda and are consequently in a
  wavering state of mind, having almost lost their self-confidence. Spiritually
  menaced by the Communists, they see only the enemy's strength but not our
  own huge strength, which is tens of times greater than the enemy's.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Well, every year brings its crop of news, but this year's is something very
special. Isn't it an extra-special piece of news that members of the Kuomintang,
with their sixty million odd officers and men, see only the People's Liberation
Army of three million odd men but not their own army of over sixty million?
<P>
One may ask, "Is there a market for such news?" and "Is it worth even a glance?"
According to information received from inside the city of Peiping, "On New
Year's Day prices dropped slightly in the morning but recovered in the
afternoon." And a foreign news agency reports, "Shanghai's response to Chiang
Kai-shek's New Year message is cold." This answers the question as to whether
the war criminal Chiang Kai-shek has any market. As we said long ago, Chiang
Kai-shek has lost his soul, is merely a corpse, and no one believes him any
more.

  <I>NOTES</I>

<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm1">1.</A> The "Sino-U.S. Air Transport Agreement" between the
Chiang Kai-shek government and U.S. imperialism was signed on December 20,
1946. In this agreement, Chiang Kai-shek completely sold out China's sovereignty
over her air space. According to its provisions, U.S. aircraft were allowed
to fly, load and unload or trans-ship anywhere within China, and the United
States gained complete control of the country's air transport. U.S. aircraft
were also accorded the right of "non-traffic stop", that is, of military
landings on Chinese territory.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm2">2.</A> The "Sino-U.S. bilateral agreement" was the so-called
Sino-U.S. Economic Aid Agreement signed at Nanking on July 3, 1948 between
the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek government and U.S. imperialism.
It stipulated that U.S. imperialism was to have supreme authority to supervise
and decide the financial and economic affairs of the Chiang Kai-shek government,
that U.S. personnel exercising direct control in China were to enjoy
"extraterritorial rights", and that U.S. imperialism could obtain from China
any strategic materials it needed and was to be kept informed regularly by
the Chiang Kai-shek government about their availability. In this agreement
the Chiang Kai-shek government also guaranteed that U.S. goods could be dumped
in China.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm3">3.</A> Chia Pao-yu was a character in <EM>The Dream of the
Red Chamber, </EM>an 18th century Chinese novel, and the Grand View Garden
was his family garden. It was said that Chia Pao-yu was born with a piece
of jade in his mouth. This jade was "the root of his life" and had to be
worn constantly around his neck. He was not to part with it. If be lost it,
he would lose his wits.
