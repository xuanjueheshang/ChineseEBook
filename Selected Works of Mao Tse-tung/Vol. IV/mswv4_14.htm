<EM>September 16, 1946</EM>
<P class="information">
[This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the
Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China.]
<P>
  <hr class="end" />
<P>
1. The method of fighting by concentrating a superior force to destroy the
enemy forces <B>[<A href="#bm1">1</A>]</B> one by one must be employed not
only in the disposition of troops for a campaign but also in the disposition
of troops for a battle.
<P>
2.<EM> </EM>With regard to the disposition for a campaign, when the enemy
employs many brigades <B>[<A href="#bm2">2</A>]</B> (or regiments) and advances
against our army from several directions, our army must concentrate an absolutely
superior force -- six, five, four or at least three times the enemy strength
-- and pick an opportune moment to encircle and wipe out one enemy brigade
(or regiment) first. It should be one of the enemy's weaker brigades (or
regiments), or one that has less support, or one stationed where the terrain
and the people are most favourable to us and unfavourable to the enemy. We
should tie down the rest of the enemy brigades (or regiments) with small
forces in order to prevent them from rushing reinforcements to the brigade
(or regiment) we are encircling and attacking so that we can destroy it first.
When this has been achieved, we should, according to the circumstances, either
wipe out one or several more enemy brigades or retire to rest and consolidate
for further fighting. (Here are two examples of the former. Our troops under
the command of Su Yu and Tan Chen-lin wiped out five thousand of the enemy's
communications police corps <B>[<A href="#bm3">3</A>]</B> near Jukao on August
22,<EM> </EM>one enemy brigade on August 26 and one and a half brigades on
August 27.<B>[<A href="#bm4">4</A>]</B> Our troops under Liu Po-cheng and
Teng Hsiao-ping annihilated one enemy brigade near Tingtao between September
3 and 6,another in the afternoon of September 6 and two more on September
7-8.<B>[<A href="#bm5">5</A>]</B> )<EM> </EM>In the disposition for a campaign,
we must reject the wrong method of fighting, which underrates the enemy and
therefore divides our forces to deal with all the enemy detachments, for
by this method we cannot destroy even one enemy detachment but will land
ourselves in a passive position.
<P>
3. In the disposition for a battle, when we have concentrated an absolutely
superior force and encircled one of the enemy detachments (a brigade or
regiment), our attacking formations (or units) should not attempt to wipe
out all the encircled enemy simultaneously at one swoop and thus divide
themselves and strike everywhere without enough strength anywhere, losing
time and making it hard to get results. Instead, we should concentrate an
absolutely superior force, that is to say, a force six, five, four or at
least three times that of the enemy, concentrate the whole or the bulk of
our artillery, select one (not two) of the weak spots in the enemy's positions,
attack it fiercely and be sure to win. This accomplished, swiftly exploit
the victory and destroy the enemy forces one by one.
<P>
4. The effects of this method of fighting are, first, complete annihilation
and, second, quick decision. Only complete annihilation can deal the most
telling blows to the enemy, for when we wipe out one regiment, he will have
one regiment less, and when we wipe out one brigade, he will have one brigade
less. This method is most useful when employed against an enemy lacking
second-line troops. Only complete annihilation can replenish our own forces
to the greatest possible extent. It is now not only the main source of our
arms and ammunition, but also an important source of our manpower. Complete
annihilation demoralizes the enemy's troops and depresses his followers;
it raises the morale of our troops and inspires our people. A quick decision
makes it possible for our troops either to wipe out the enemy reinforcements
one by one or evade them. Quick decision in battle and campaign is a necessary
condition for the strategy of a protracted war.
<P>
5. Among our military cadres there are still many who, when not in action,
approve the principle of concentrating our forces to wipe out the enemy forces
one by one, but often fail to apply it in action. That is due to underestimation
of the enemy and to lack of intensive education and study. It is necessary
to cite detailed cases of past battles to explain again and again the advantages
of this method of fighting and to point out that it is the chief method of
defeating Chiang Kai-shek's attacks. Using this method we shall win. Acting
counter to it we shall lose.
<P>
6. The principle of concentrating our forces to wipe out the enemy forces
one by one has been a fine tradition of our army ever since its founding
more than a decade ago; this is not the first time it has been put forward.
During the War of Resistance Against Japan, however, the dispersal of our
forces for guerrilla warfare was primary, and the concentration of our forces
for mobile warfare was supplementary. In the present civil war, as conditions
have changed, so should the method of fighting. The concentration of our
forces for mobile warfare should be primary, and the dispersal of our forces
for guerrilla warfare should be supplementary. Now that Chiang Kai-shek's
army has acquired more powerful weapons, it is necessary for our army to
lay special stress on the method of concentrating a superior force to wipe
out the enemy forces one by one.
<P>
7. When the enemy is on the offensive and we are on the defensive, this method
must be employed. However, when the enemy is on the defensive and we are
on the offensive, we should distinguish between two kinds of situations and
adopt different methods. When our force is big and the enemy in that locality
is rather weak, or when we are making a surprise attack on the enemy, we
may strike at several of his units simultaneously. For example, between June
5 and 10, our troops in Shantung Province simultaneously attacked and captured
more than ten towns on the Tsingtao-Tsinan and the Tientsin-Pukow
Railways.<B>[<A href="#bm6">6</A>]</B> Or to take another example, between
August 10 and 21, our troops under Liu Po-cheng and Teng Hsiao-ping attacked
and captured more than ten towns along the section of the Lunghai Railway
between Kaifeng and Hsuchow.<B>[<A href="#bm7">7</A>]</B> On the other hand,
when we do not have enough forces, we should seize the enemy-occupied towns
one by one and should not attack the enemy at several towns simultaneously.
That was how our forces in Shansi Province took the towns along the Tatung-Puchow
Railway.<B>[<A href="#bm8">8</A>]</B>
<P>
8. When the main force of our troops is concentrated to annihilate the enemy,
it must co-ordinate its operations with vigorous activities by the regional
formations, local guerrillas and people's militia. When regional formations
(or troops) attack an enemy regiment, battalion or company, they should also
adopt the principle of concentrating our forces to annihilate the enemy forces
one by one.
<P>
9. The principle of concentrating our forces to wipe out the enemy forces
one by one is aimed chiefly at annihilating the enemy's effective strength,
not at holding or seizing a place. In some circumstances, it is permissible
to abandon certain places for the purpose of concentrating our forces to
wipe out the enemy or of enabling our main force to avoid heavy enemy attacks
and to facilitate rest and consolidation for further fighting. So long as
we are able to wipe out the enemy's effective strength on a large scale,
it will be possible to recover lost territory and seize new territory. Therefore,
all those who succeed in destroying the enemy's effective strength should
be commended. This applies not only to those who destroy the enemy's regular
forces but also to those who destroy his peace preservation corps, home-going
contingents <B>[<A href="#bm9">9</A>]</B> and other reactionary local armed
bands. However, we must hold or seize territory wherever the relative strength
of the enemy and our own forces makes this possible or wherever such territory
is significant for our campaigns or battles; to do otherwise would be a mistake.
Therefore, those who succeed in holding or seizing such territory should
also be commended.

<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm1">1.</A> The expressions "to destroy the enemy", "to wipe out
the enemy" and "to annihilate the enemy" are used as synonyms in this book.
They all include enemy troops killed, wounded and captured. To wipe out
(annihilate, destroy) an enemy force means either to wipe it out completely
or to wipe out the major part of that force.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm2">2.</A> A regular corps of the Kuomintang army originally consisted
of three (sometimes two) divisions, each with three regiments. Beginning
in May 1946 the Kuomintang regular troops south of the Yellow River were
reorganized in stages; what had been a corps became a reorganized division
and with three (sometimes two) regiments. Part of the Kuomintang troops north
of the Yellow River were not reorganized, and their designations remained
the same. Some of the reorganized divisions later reverted to their original
designation of corps.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm3">3.</A> The communications police corps of the Kuomintang was
formed in March 1945. Following Japan's surrender, the corps was deployed
along communication lines for "garrison duties" under the pretext of guarding
the railways, but actually to carry on secret police activities. It was one
of the forces the Kuomintang used for fighting the civil war.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm4">4.</A> In July 1946 the Kuomintang forces began a large-scale
invasion of the Kiangsu-Anhwei Liberated Area, and our army fought bravely
in self-defence. The Kuomintang troops attacking the Central Kiangsu Liberated
Area consisted of fifteen brigades with about 120,000 men under Tang En-po.
From July 13 to August 27, eighteen regiments of the Eastern China People's
Liberation Army, commanded by Su Yu, Tan Chen-lin and other comrades,
concentrated superior forces and fought seven successive battles in the region
of Taihsing, Jukao, Hai-an and Shaopai in central Kiangsu. Our forces wiped
out six enemy brigades and five battalions of the enemy's communications
police corps. The text refers to the results of two of these battles.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm5">5.</A> In August 1946 the Kuomintang forces advanced along
two routes from the Hsuchow and Chengchow sectors and attacked the
Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan Liberated Area. The People's Liberation Army
of this area, under the command of Liu Po-cheng, Teng Hsiao-ping and other
comrades, concentrated superior forces to engage the enemy detachment advancing
from Chengchow. Between September 3 and 8 they wiped out four enemy brigades
in succession in the region of Hotse, Tingtao and Tsaohsien in Shantung Province.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm6">6.</A> Early in June 1946 the Shantung People's Liberation
Army sent an expedition against the puppet troops along the Tsingtao-Tsinan
and Tientsin-Pukow Railways and liberated more than ten towns, including
Chiaohsien, Changtien, Choutsun, Tehchow, Tai-an and Tsaochuang.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm7">7.</A> From August 10 to 21, 1946, the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan
People's Liberation Army, supporting the Central Plains and Eastern China
People's Liberation Armies, moved by several routes and attacked the enemy
troops stationed along the Kaifeng-Hsuchow section of the Lunghai Railway,
capturing more than ten towns, including Tangshan, Lanfeng, Huangkou, Lichuang
and Yangchi.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm8">8.</A> In July 1946 the Kuomintang forces under Hu Tsung-nan
and Yen Hsi-shan jointly attacked the Southern Shansi Liberated Area. The
Taiyueh units of the Shansi-Hopei- Shantung-Honan People's Liberation Army
and a part of the Shansi-Suiynan People's Liberation Army counter-attacked
and beat back the enemy in southern Shansi. In August they started an offensive
against the enemy between Linfen and Lingshih along the Tatung-Puchow Railway
and liberated the towns of Hungtung, Chaocheng, Huohsien, Lingshih and Fenhsi.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm9">9.</A> During the People's War of Liberation some landlords
and local tyrants in the Liberated Areas fled to the Kuomintang areas. They
were organized by the Kuomintang into "home-going contingents", "home-going
legions" and other reactionary armed bands to attack the Liberated Areas
together with the Kuomintang troops. Everywhere they robbed, killed and committed
all kinds of atrocities.
