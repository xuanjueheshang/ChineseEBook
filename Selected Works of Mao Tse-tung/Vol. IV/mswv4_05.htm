  ON PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE KUOMINTANG -- CIRCULAR OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE
  OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA
</H1>
<p class="title">
<EM>August 26, 1945</EM> 
<P class="information">
[This inner-Party circular was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China two days before he went to Chungking
for peace negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek. Because the Chinese Communist
Party and the broad masses of the Chinese people firmly opposed Chiang Kai-shek's
civil war plot and because U.S. imperialism still had to pay some heed to
world-wide democratic public opinion, which unanimously condemned his policy
of civil war and dictatorship, Chiang sent three telegrams to Comrade Mao
Tse-tung on August 14, 20 and 23, 1945, inviting him to Chungking for peace
negotiations, and for the same purpose Patrick J. Hurley, then U.S. ambassador
to China, came to Yenan on August 27. The Communist Party of China decided
to send Comrades Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-lai and Wang Jo-fei to Chungking for
peace negotiations with the Kuomintang in order to make every possible effort
for peace and also, in the process of struggling for peace, to show U.S.
imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek in their true colours and so help unite and
educate the masses of the people. This circular drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung
analysed developments in China during the fortnight after Japan announced
her surrender. It set forth the policy of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China on the peace negotiations, certain concessions the Party was
prepared to make in the negotiations and policies for coping with the two
possible outcomes of the negotiations. It contained directives concerning
the principles to be followed in the struggles in the Liberated Areas of
northern and eastern China and of central and southern China respectively.
And it warned the whole Party that it must absolutely not relax its vigilance
or its struggle against Chiang Kai-shek because negotiations were to take
place. Comrade Mao Tse-tung and his colleagues arrived in Chungking on August
28 and held negotiations with the Kuomintang for forty-three days. Although
the negotiations resulted only in the publication of the "Summary of
Conversations Between the Representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist
Party of China" (also known as the "October 10th Agreement"), they were
nevertheless successful in that politically they enabled the Chinese Communist
Party to gain the initiative to a great extent and put the Kuomintang in
a passive position. Comrade Mao Tse-tung returned to Yenan on October 11.
Comrades Chou En-lai and Wang Jo-fei remained in Chungking to continue the
negotiations. For the results see "On the Chungking Negotiations", the next
article in this volume.]

<P>
The speedy surrender of the Japanese invaders has changed the whole situation.
Chiang Kai-shek has monopolized the right to accept the surrender, and for
the time being (for a stage) the big cities and important lines of communication
will not be in our hands. Nevertheless, in northern China we should still
fight hard, fight with all our might to take all we can. In the past two
weeks our army has recovered fifty-nine cities of various sizes and vast
rural areas, and including those already in our hands we now control 175
cities, thus winning a great victory. In northern China, we have recovered
Weihaiwei, Yentai, Lungkou, Itu, Tsechuan, Yangliuching, Pikechi, Po-ai,
Changchiakou, Chining and Fengchen. The might of our army has shaken northern
China and, together with the sweeping advance of the Soviet and Mongolian
forces to the Great Wall, has created a favourable position for our Party.
In the coming period we should continue the offensive and do our best to
capture the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway, the northern section of the Tatung-Puchow
Railway and the Chengting-Taiyuan, Tehchow-Shihchiachuang, Paikuei-Chincheng
and Taokou-Chinghua Railways; and also to cut up the Peiping-Liaoning,
Peiping-Hankow, Tientsin-Pukow, Tsingtao-Tsinan, Lunghai and Shanghai-Nanking
Railways. We should gain control of whatever we can, even though temporarily.
At the same time, the necessary forces should be employed to take as many
villages, county and higher administrative centres and small towns as possible.
For example, a highly favourable situation has been created because the New
Fourth Army has occupied Nanking, Taihu Lake and the Tienmu Mountains and
between the Yangtse and the Huai Rivers, because our forces in Shantung have
occupied the whole of the Eastern Shantung Peninsula and because our forces
in the Shansi-Suiyuan Border Region have occupied many cities and towns north
and south of the Peiping-Suiynan Railway. After another period of offensive
operations, it will be possible for our Party to control most of the areas
north of the lower Yangtse River and the Huai River, most of Shantung, Hopei,
Shansi and Suiyuan Provinces, all of Jehol and Chahar Provinces and a part
of Liaoning Province. 

<P>
At present the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain all disapprove
of civil war in China; <STRONG>[<A href="#bm1">1</A>] </STRONG>at the same
time our Party has put forward the three great slogans of peace, democracy
and unity <STRONG>[<A href="#bm2">2</A>]</STRONG> and is sending Comrades
Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-lai and Wang Jo-fei to Chungking to discuss with Chiang
Kai-shek the great issues of unity and national reconstruction, thus it is
possible that the civil war plot of the Chinese reactionaries may be frustrated.
The Kuomintang has now strengthened its position by recovering Shanghai,
Nanking and other places, reopening sea communications, taking over the arms
of the enemy and incorporating the puppet troops into its own forces.
Nevertheless, it is riddled with a thousand gaping wounds, torn by innumerable
inner contradictions and beset with great difficulties. It is possible that
after the negotiations the Kuomintang, under domestic and foreign pressure,
may conditionally recognize our Party's status. Our Party too may conditionally
recognize the status of the Kuomintang. This would bring about a new stage
of cooperation between the two parties (plus the Democratic League,
<STRONG>[<A href="#bm3">3</A>]</STRONG> etc.) and of peaceful development.
In that event, our Party should strive to master all methods of legal struggle
and intensify in the Kuomintang areas in the three main spheres, the cities,
the villages and the army (all weak points in our work there). During the
negotiations, the Kuomintang is sure to demand that we drastically reduce
the size of the Liberated Areas, cut down the strength of the Liberation
Army and stop issuing currency. We on our side are prepared to make such
concessions as are necessary and as do not damage the fundamental interests
of the people. Without such concessions, we cannot explode the Kuomintang's
civil war plot, cannot gain the political initiative, cannot win the sympathy
of world public opinion and the middle-of-the-roaders within the country
and cannot obtain in exchange legal status for our Party and a state of peace.
But there are limits to such concessions; the principle is that they must
not damage the fundamental interests of the people. 

<P>
If the Kuomintang still wants to launch civil war after our Party has taken
the above steps, it will put itself in the wrong in the eyes of the whole
nation and the whole world, and our Party will be justified in waging a war
of self-defence to crush its attacks. Moreover, our Party is powerful, and
if anyone attacks us and if the conditions are favourable for battle, we
will certainly act in self-defence to wipe him out resolutely, thoroughly,
wholly and completely (we do not strike rashly, but when we do strike, we
must win). We must never be cowed by the bluster of reactionaries. But we
must at all times firmly adhere to, and never forget, these principles: unity,
struggle, unity through struggle; to wage struggles with good reason, with
advantage and with restraint; and to make use of contradictions, win over
the many, oppose the few and crush our enemies one by one.
<STRONG>[<A href="#bm4">4</A>]</STRONG>
<P>
In Kwangtung, Hunan, Hupeh, Honan and some other provinces our Party forces
are in a more difficult position than in northern China and the area between
the Yangtse and the Huai Rivers. The comrades in those places are much in
the thoughts of the Central Committee. But the Kuomintang has many weak spots
and its areas are vast; our comrades will be fully able to deal with the
situation, provided they make no big mistakes in military policy (movements
and operations) and in the policy of uniting with the people, and provided
they are modest and prudent, not conceited or rash. Besides receiving the
necessary directives from the Central Committee, the comrades in these areas
must use their own judgement to analyse the situation, solve their problems,
surmount difficulties, maintain themselves and expand their forces. When
the Kuomintang becomes unable to do anything with you, it may be compelled
in the negotiations between the two parties to give your forces recognition
and agree to arrangements advantageous to both sides. But you must definitely
not rely on the negotiations, must definitely not hope that the Kuomintang
will be kind-hearted, because it will never be kind-hearted. You must rely
on your own strength, on correct guidance of activities, on brotherly unity
within the Party and good relations with the people. Firmly rely on the people,
that is your way out. 

<P>
To sum up, our Party is confronted with many difficulties which must not
be ignored, and all Party comrades must be well prepared mentally. But the
general trend of the international and internal situation is favourable to
our Party and to the people. So long as the whole Party is united as one,
we shall be able to overcome all difficulties step by step.

<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm1">1</A>. Around the time of Japan's surrender, the Soviet Union,
the United States and Britain for a period all expressed disapproval of civil
war in China. Events soon demonstrated, however, that the U.S. statement
about its so-called disapproval of civil war in China was only a screen for
actively helping the reactionary Kuomintang government prepare for a
counter-revolutionary civil war.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm2">2</A>. The three great slogans of peace, democracy and unity
were put forward in the "Declaration on the Current Situation" by the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China on August 25, 1945. The declaration
pointed out that after the surrender of Japanese imperialism, "the important
task confronting the whole nation is to consolidate unity in the country,
safeguard domestic peace, bring about democracy and improve the people's
livelihood so as, on the basis of peace, democracy and unity, to achieve
national unification and build a new China, independent, free, prosperous
and powerful". 
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm3">3</A>. The Democratic League was formed in 1941 under the name
of the China Federation of Democratic Political Groups. It was reorganized
under the name of the China Democratic League in 1944.
