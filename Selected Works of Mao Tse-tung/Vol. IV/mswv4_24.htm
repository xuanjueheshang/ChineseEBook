<p class="title">
<EM>December 25, 1947</EM>
<P class="information">
[This report was made by Comrade Mao Tse-tung to a meeting of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China held on December 25-28 1947, at
Yangchiakou, Michih County, northern Shensi. In addition to those members
and alternate members of the Central Committee able to attend, responsible
comrades of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and the Shansi-Suiyuan
Border Region were present. The meeting discussed and adopted this report
and also another document written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung,
"<A HREF="mswv4_11.htm">Some Points in Appraisal of the Present International
Situation</A>" (see pp. 87-88 of this volume). Concerning Comrade Mao Tse-tung's
report, the decision adopted at the meeting stated, "This report is a
programmatic document in the political, military and economic fields for
the entire period of the overthrow of the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek ruling
clique and of the founding of a new-democratic China. The whole Party and
the whole army should carry on intensive education around, and strictly apply
in practice, this document and, in connection with it, the documents published
on October 10, 1947 [namely, 'Manifesto of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army', 'Slogans of the Chinese People's Liberation Army', 'Instruction on
the Reissue of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for
Attention', 'Outline Land Law of China' and 'Resolution of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China on the Promulgation of the Outline Land Law
of China']. In carrying out policies in different places any departure from
the principles laid down in the report should be rectified at once." Other
important decisions taken at the meeting were<B>: </B>
<P class="information">
(1) That every effort should be made to carry the Chinese people's revolutionary
war forward uninterruptedly to complete victory, and that the enemy should
not be allowed to use stalling tactics (peace negotiations) to gain time
for rest and reorganization for a fresh attack on the people.
<P class="information">
(2) That the time was not yet ripe for the formation of a revolutionary central
government, which was to be considered only when our army had won greater
victories, and that the promulgation of a constitution was even more a question
for the future.
<P class="information">
The meeting also discussed in detail current tendencies in the Party and
certain specific policies in the land reform and the mass movements. The
results of these discussions were subsequently set forth by Comrade Mao Tse-tung
in the article "<A HREF="mswv4_26.htm">On Some Important Problems of the
Party's Present Policy</A>" (see pp. 181-89 of this volume). All the articles
in this book starting with this report and ending with
"<A HREF="mswv4_34.htm">A Circular on the Situation</A>", dated March 20,
1948 (pp. 219-26), were written at Yangchiakou, Michih County, northern Shensi.]

The Chinese people's revolutionary war has now reached a turning point. That
is, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has beaten back the offensive of
several million reactionary troops of Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of
the United States of America, and gone over to the offensive. Already in
the first year of the present war, from July 1946 to June 1947, the People's
Liberation Army beat back Chiang Kai-shek's offensive on several fronts and
forced him onto the defensive. And beginning with the first quarter of the
second year of the war, July-September 1947, the People's Liberation Army
went over to the offensive on a national scale and wrecked Chiang Kai-shek's
counter-revolutionary plan of continuing to carry the war into the Liberated
Areas in order to destroy them completely. Now the war is no longer being
fought chiefly in the Liberated Areas but in the Kuomintang areas; the main
forces of the People's Liberation Army have carried the fight into the Kuomintang
areas.<B>[<A href="#bm1">1</A>]</B> In this land of China, the People's
Liberation Army has turned back the wheel of counterrevolution -- of U.S.
imperialism and its lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang -- and sent it
down the road to destruction and has pushed the wheel of revolution forward
along the road to victory. This is a turning point in history. It is the
turning point from growth to extinction for Chiang Kai-shek's twenty-year
counter-revolutionary rule. It is the turning point from growth to extinction
for imperialist rule in China, now over a hundred years old. This is a momentous
event. It is momentous because it is occurring in a country with a population
of 475 million and, having occurred, it will certainly culminate in victory
throughout the country. Furthermore, it is momentous because it is occurring
in the East, where over 1,000 million people -- half of mankind -- suffer
under imperialist oppression. The turn of the Chinese People's War of Liberation
from the defensive to the offensive cannot but gladden and inspire these
oppressed nations. It is also of assistance to the oppressed people now
struggling in many countries in Europe and the Americas.
<h4>
<B>II</B></h4>
<P>
From the day Chiang Kai-shek started his counter-revolutionary war we said
that we not only must defeat him but can defeat him. We must defeat him because
the war he started is a counter-revolutionary war directed by U.S. imperialism
against the independence of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the
Chinese people. After the conclusion of World War II and the overthrow of
Japanese imperialism, the task of the Chinese people was to complete the
new-democratic transformation politically, economically and culturally, to
achieve national unification and independence and to change China from an
agricultural into an industrial country. But at that time, after the victorious
conclusion of the anti-fascist Second World War, U.S. imperialism and its
lackeys in various countries stepped into the shoes of German and Japanese
imperialism and their lackeys and formed a reactionary camp against the Soviet
Union, against the People's Democracies in Europe, against the workers' movements
in the capitalist countries, against the national movements in the colonies
and semi-colonies and against the liberation of the Chinese people. At such
a time the Chinese reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek acted as the running
dog for U.S. imperialism, just as Wang Ching-wei had done for Japanese
imperialism, sold out China to the United States and unleashed a war against
the Chinese people to check the advance of their liberation. At such a time,
if we had shown weakness or given ground and had not dared to rise resolutely
to oppose counterrevolutionary war with revolutionary war, China would have
become a world of darkness and the future of our nation would have been
forfeited. The Communist Party of China has led the Chinese People's Liberation
Army in firmly waging a patriotic, just and revolutionary war against Chiang
Kai-shek's offensive. The Communist Party of China, having made a clear-headed
appraisal of the international and domestic situation on the basis of the
science of Marxism-Leninism, recognized that all attacks by the reactionaries
at home and abroad not only had to be defeated but could be defeated. When
dark clouds appeared in the sky, we pointed out that this was only temporary,
that the darkness would soon pass and the sun break through. When the Chiang
Kai-shek bandit gang launched the country-wide counter-revolutionary war
in July 1946, they thought it would take them only three to six months to
defeat the People's Liberation Army. They reckoned that they had a regular
army of two million, more than a million irregulars and another million or
more men in the military establishments and armed units in the rear, making
a total military strength of more than four million; that they had taken
time to complete their preparations for the offensive; that they had regained
control of the big cities; that they had a population of more than 300 million;
that they had taken over all the equipment of a million Japanese invading
troops; and that they had received huge military and financial aid from the
U.S. government. They also reckoned that the People's Liberation Army was
tired after fighting for eight years in the War of Resistance Against Japan
and was far inferior to the Kuomintang army in numbers and equipment; that
the population of the Liberated Areas was only a little more than 100 million;
and that in most of these areas the reactionary feudal forces had not yet
been cleaned up and the land reform had not yet been universally and thoroughly
carried out, namely, that the rear area of the People's Liberation Army had
not yet been consolidated. Proceeding from this appraisal, the Chiang Kai-shek
bandit gang ignored the Chinese people's desire for peace, finally tore up
the truce agreement signed by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in January
1946 as well as the resolutions adopted by the Political Consultative Conference
of all parties and launched an adventurist war. We said then that Chiang
Kai-shek's superiority in military forces was only transient, a factor which
could play only a temporary role, that U.S. imperialist aid was likewise
a factor which could play only a temporary role, while the anti-popular character
of Chiang Kai-shek's war and the feelings of the people were factors that
would play a constant role, and that in this respect the People's Liberation
Army was in a superior position. Patriotic, just and revolutionary in character,
the war waged by the People's Liberation Army was bound to win the support
of the people of the whole country. That was the political foundation for
victory over Chiang Kai-shek. The experience of eighteen months of war has
fully confirmed our judgement.
<h4>
<B>III</B></h4>
<P>
In seventeen months of fighting (from July 1946 to November 1947; December
figures are not yet available), we killed, wounded and captured 1,690,000
of Chiang Kai-shek's regular and irregular troops -- 640,000 killed and wounded
and 1,050,000 captured. Thus we were able to beat back Chiang Kai-shek's
offensive, preserve the main territories of the Liberated Areas and go over
to the offensive. Speaking from the military aspect, we were able to do this
because we employed the correct strategy. Our principles of operation are<B>:
</B>
<P class="indentb">
1. Attack dispersed, isolated enemy forces first; attack concentrated, strong
enemy forces later.
<P class="indentb">
2. Take small and medium cities and extensive rural areas first; take big
cities later.
<P class="indentb">
3. Make wiping out the enemy's effective strength our main objective; do
not make holding or seizing a city or place our main objective. Holding or
seizing a city or place is the outcome of wiping out the enemy's effective
strength, and often a city or place can be held or seized for good only after
it has changed hands a number of times.
<P class="indentb">
4. In every battle, concentrate an absolutely superior force (two, three,
four and sometimes even five or six times the enemy's strength), encircle
the enemy forces completely, strive to wipe them out thoroughly and do not
let any escape from the net. In special circumstances, use the method of
dealing crushing blows to the enemy, that is, concentrate all our strength
to make a frontal attack and also to attack one or both of his flanks, with
the aim of wiping out one part and routing another so that our army can swiftly
move its troops to smash other enemy forces. Strive to avoid battles of attrition
in which we lose more than we gain or only break even. In this way, although
we are inferior as a whole (in terms of numbers), we are absolutely superior
in every part and every specific campaign, and this ensures victory in the
campaign. As time goes on, we shall become superior as a whole and eventually
wipe out all the enemy.
<P class="indentb">
5. Fight no battle unprepared, fight no battle you are not sure of winning;
make every effort to be well prepared for each battle, make every effort
to ensure victory in the given set of conditions as between the enemy and
ourselves.
<P class="indentb">
6. Give full play to our style of fighting -- courage in battle, no fear
of sacrifice, no fear of fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting
successive battles in a short time without rest).
<P class="indentb">
7. Strive to wipe out the enemy through mobile warfare. At the same time,
pay attention to the tactics of positional attack and capture enemy fortified
points and cities.
<P class="indentb">
8. With regard to attacking cities, resolutely seize all enemy fortified
points and cities which are weakly defended. Seize at opportune moments all
enemy fortified points and cities defended with moderate strength, provided
circumstances permit. As for strongly defended enemy fortified points and
cities, wait till conditions are ripe and then take them.
<P class="indentb">
9. Replenish our strength with all the arms and most of the personnel captured
from the enemy. Our army's main sources of manpower and mat&eacute;riel are
at the front.
<P class="indentb">
10. Make good use of the intervals between campaigns to rest, train and
consolidate our troops. Periods of rest, training and consolidation should
in general not be very long, and the enemy should so far as possible be permitted
no breathing space.
<P>
These are the main methods the People's Liberation Army has employed in defeating
Chiang Kai-shek. They are the result of the tempering of the People's Liberation
Army in long years of fighting against domestic and foreign enemies and are
completely suited to our present situation. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang
and the U.S. imperialist military personnel in China are very well acquainted
with these military methods of ours. Seeking ways to counter them, Chiang
Kai-shek has often assembled his generals and field officers for training
and distributed for their study our military literature and the documents
captured in the war. The U.S. military personnel have recommended to Chiang
Kai-shek one kind of strategy and tactics after another for destroying the
People's Liberation Army; they have trained Chiang Kai-shek's troops and
supplied them with military equipment. But none of these efforts can save
the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang from defeat. The reason is that our strategy
and tactics are based on a people's war; no army opposed to the people can
use our strategy and tactics. On the basis of a people's war and of the
principles of unity between army and people, of unity between commanders
and fighters and of disintegrating the enemy troops, the People's Liberation
Army has developed its vigorous revolutionary political work, which is an
important factor in winning victory over the enemy. When we abandoned many
cities on our own initiative in order to evade fatal blows from superior
enemy forces and shift our forces to destroy the enemy in mobile warfare,
our enemies were jubilant. They took this to be their victory and our defeat.
They became dizzy with this momentary "victory". On the afternoon of the
day he seized Changchiakou, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the convening of his
reactionary National Assembly, as though his reactionary regime had from
that moment become as stable as Mount Taishan. The U.S. imperialists, too,
danced with joy, as though their wild scheme for converting China into a
U.S. colony could now be realized without obstruction. But with the lapse
of time, Chiang Kai-shek and his U.S. masters began to change their tune.
Now all our enemies, domestic and foreign, are gripped by pessimism. They
heave great sighs, wail about a crisis and no longer show any sign of joy.
In the past eighteen months, most of Chiang Kai-shek's high-ranking field
commanders have been replaced for losing battles. Among them are Liu Chih
(Chengchow), Hsueh Yueh (Hsuchow), Wu Chi-wei (northern Kiangsu), Tang En-po
(southern Shantung), Wang Chung-lien (northern Honan), Tu Yu-ming and Hsiung
Shih-hui (Shenyang) and Sun Lien-chung (Peiping). Chen Cheng, too, was relieved
of his post as Chiang Kai-shek's chief of staff in over-all command of operations
and demoted to command a single front in the
Northeast.<B>[<A href="#bm2">2</A>]</B> However, it was in the very period
when Chiang Kai-shek himself assumed overall command in Chen Cheng's place
that the situation changed and that his armies shifted from the offensive
to the defensive, while the People's Liberation Army went over from the defensive
to the offensive. By now the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique and its U.S.
masters should have realized their mistake. They had regarded as signs of
cowardice and weakness all the efforts for peace and against civil war which
the Communist Party of China, representing the wishes of the Chinese people,
had made over a long period after the surrender of Japan. They had overestimated
their own strength, underestimated the strength of the revolution and rashly
unleashed the war and so were caught in their own trap. Our enemy's strategic
calculations failed completely.
<h4>

<P>
The rear areas of the People's Liberation Army are much more consolidated
now than eighteen months ago. The reason is that our Party, standing resolutely
on the side of the peasants, has carried out the land reform. During the
War of Resistance Against Japan, our Party, on its own initiative and for
the sake of forming an anti-Japanese united front with the Kuomintang and
uniting with those who could still oppose Japanese imperialism, changed its
pre-war policy of confiscating the land of the landlords and distributing
it among the peasants to the policy of reducing rent and interest. This was
entirely necessary. After the Japanese surrender, the peasants urgently demanded
land, and we made a timely decision to change our land policy from reducing
rent and interest to confiscating the land of the landlord class for distribution
among the peasants. The directive issued by the Central Committee of our
Party on May 4, 1946,<B>[<A href="#bm3">3</A>]</B> marked this change. In
September 1947 our Party called the National Land Conference and drew up
the Outline Land Law of China,<B>[<A href="#bm4">4</A>]</B> which was promptly
carried out in all areas. This measure not only reaffirmed the policy set
forth in last year's "May 4th Directive" but also explicitly corrected a
certain lack of thoroughness in that directive. The Outline Land Law provides
for equal distribution of land per head,<B>[<A href="#bm5">5</A>]</B> based
on the principle of abolishing the land system of feudal and semi-feudal
exploitation and putting into effect the system of land to the tillers. This
is a method which most thoroughly abolishes the feudal system and fully meets
the demands of the broad masses of China's peasants. To carry out the land
reform resolutely and thoroughly, it is necessary to organize in the villages,
as lawful bodies for carrying out the reform, not only peasant associations
on the broadest mass basis, including farm labourers, poor peasants and middle
peasants and their elected committees, but first of all poor peasant leagues
composed of poor peasants and farm labourers and their elected committees;
and these poor peasant leagues should be the backbone of leadership in all
rural struggles. Our policy is to rely on the poor peasants and unite solidly
with the middle peasants to abolish the feudal and semi-feudal system of
exploitation by the landlord class and by the old-type rich peasants. Landlords
or rich peasants must not be allotted more land and property than the peasant
masses. But there should be no repetition of the wrong ultra-Left policy,
which was carried out in 1931-34, of "allotting no land to the landlords
and poor land to the rich peasants". Although the proportion of landlords
and rich peasants in the rural population varies from place to place, it
is generally only about 8 per cent (in terms of households), while their
holdings usually amount to 70 to 80 per cent of all the land. Therefore the
targets of our land reform are very few, while the people in the villages
who can and should take part in the united front for land reform are many
-- more than 90 per cent (in terms of households). Here two fundamental
principles must be observed. First, the demands of the poor peasants and
farm labourers must be satisfied; this is the most fundamental task in the
land reform. Second, there must be firm unity with the middle peasants, and
their interests must not be damaged. As long as we grasp these two basic
principles, we can certainly carry out our tasks in the land reform successfully.
The reason why, under the principle of equal distribution, the surplus land
and part of the property of the old-type rich peasants should be handed over
for distribution is that the rich peasants in China generally and to a great
degree have the character of feudal and semi-feudal exploiters; most of them
also rent out land and practice usury and they hire labour on semi-feudal
terms.<B>[<A href="#bm6">6</A>]</B> Furthermore, as the rich peasants have
more and better land,<B>[<A href="#bm7">7</A>]</B> the demands of the poor
peasants and farm labourers cannot be satisfied unless this land is distributed.
However, in accordance with the Outline Land Law, rich peasants should generally
be treated differently from landlords. In the land reform, the middle peasants
show approval of equal distribution because it does no harm to their interests.
Under equal distribution, the land of one section of the middle peasants
remains unchanged and that of another is increased; only the section of
well-to-do middle peasants has a little surplus land, and they are willing
to hand it over for equal distribution because their burden of land tax will
then be lightened. Nevertheless, in carrying out equal distribution of land
in different places, it is necessary to listen to the opinions of the middle
peasants and make concessions to them if they object. During the confiscation
and distribution of the land and property of the feudal class, the needs
of certain middle peasants should receive attention. In determining class
status care must be taken to avoid the mistake of classifying middle peasants
as rich peasants. The active middle peasants must be drawn into the work
of the peasant association committees and the government. With respect to
the burdens of the land tax and of supporting the war, the principle of being
fair and reasonable must be observed. These are the specific policies our
Party must follow in carrying out its strategic task of uniting solidly with
the middle peasants. The whole Party must understand that thoroughgoing reform
of the land system is a basic task of the Chinese revolution in its present
stage. If we can solve the land problem universally and completely, we shall
have obtained the most fundamental condition for the defeat of all our enemies.
<h4>
<B>V</B></h4>
<P>
To carry out the land reform resolutely and thoroughly and to consolidate
the rear areas of the People's Liberation Army, it is necessary to educate
and reorganize the ranks of our Party. On the whole, the rectification
movement<B>[<A href="#bm8">8</A>]</B> inside the Party during the War of
Resistance Against Japan was successful. Its main success was that our leading
bodies and large numbers of cadres and Party members obtained a firmer grasp
of our basic orientation, which is to unite the universal truth of
Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. In
this respect our Party has taken a big stride forward as compared with all
the historical stages before the War of Resistance. However, in the Party's
local organizations, especially the organizations at the primary level in
the countryside, the problem of impurities in the class composition of our
ranks and in our style of work is still unsolved. During the eleven years
1937-47 the membership of our Party has grown from several tens of thousands
to 2,700,000, and this is a very big leap forward. This has made our Party
a more powerful party than any in Chinese history. It has enabled us to defeat
Japanese imperialism, beat back Chiang Kai-shek's offensives, lead the Liberated
Areas with a population of more than 100 million and lead a People's Liberation
Army two million strong. But shortcomings have also cropped up. Many landlords,
rich peasants and riffraff have seized the opportunity to sneak into our
Party. In the rural areas they control a number of Party, government and
people's organizations, tyrannically abuse their power, ride roughshod over
the people, distort the Party's policies and thus alienate these organizations
from the masses and prevent the land reform from being thorough. This grave
situation sets us the task of educating and reorganizing the ranks of our
Party. We cannot make headway in the countryside unless we perform this task.
The Party's National Land Conference discussed this problem thoroughly and
laid down the proper measures and methods. These are now being resolutely
applied everywhere, together with the decision on the equal distribution
of land. First and foremost comes the unfolding of criticism and self-criticism
within the Party and the thorough exposure of mistaken ideas and serious
situations in the local organizations, which are departures from the Party
line. All Party members must realize that a decisive link in the solution
of the land problem and for the support of the long-drawn-out war is the
removal of impurities from Party organizations and the education and
reorganization of the Party's ranks, so that the Party and the broadest masses
of working people can all march in the same direction and the Party can lead
the masses forward.
<h4>
<B>VI</B></h4>
<P>
Confiscate the land of the feudal class and turn it over to the peasants.
Confiscate monopoly capital, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, T. V. Soong, H. H.
Kung and Chen Li-fu, and turn it over to the new-democratic state. Protect
the industry and commerce of the national bourgeoisie. These are the three
major economic policies of the new-democratic revolution. During their
twenty-year rule, the four big families, Chiang, Soong, Kung and Chen, have
piled up enormous fortunes valued at ten to twenty thousand million U.S.
dollars and monopolized the economic lifelines of the whole country. This
monopoly capital, combined with state power, has become state-monopoly
capitalism. This monopoly capitalism, closely tied up with foreign imperialism,
the domestic landlord class and the old-type rich peasants, has become comprador,
feudal, state-monopoly capitalism. Such is the economic base of Chiang Kai-shek's
reactionary regime. This state-monopoly capitalism oppresses not only the
workers and peasants but also the urban petty bourgeoisie, and it injures
the middle bourgeoisie. This state-monopoly capitalism reached the peak of
its development during the War of Resistance and after the Japanese surrender;
it has prepared ample material conditions for the new-democratic revolution.
This capital is popularly known in China as bureaucrat-capital. This capitalist
class, known as the bureaucrat-capitalist class, is the big bourgeoisie of
China. Besides doing away with the special privileges of imperialism in China,
the task of the new-democratic revolution at home is to abolish exploitation
and oppression by the landlord class and by the bureaucrat-capitalist class
(the big bourgeoisie), change the comprador, feudal relations of production
and unfetter the productive forces. The upper petty bourgeoisie and middle
bourgeoisie, oppressed and injured by the landlords and big bourgeoisie and
their state power, may take part in the new-democratic revolution or stay
neutral, though they are themselves bourgeois. They have no ties, or
comparatively few, with imperialism and are the genuine national bourgeoisie.
Wherever the state power of New Democracy extends, it must firmly and
unhesitatingly protect them. In Chiang Kai-shek's areas, there are a small
number of people among the upper petty bourgeoisie and the middle bourgeoisie,
the right wing of these classes, who have reactionary political tendencies,
spread illusions about U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek
clique and oppose the people's democratic revolution. As long as their
reactionary tendencies can affect the masses, we should unmask them before
the people under their political influence, attack this influence and liberate
the masses from it. But political attack and economic annihilation are two
different matters, and we shall make mistakes if we confuse the two. The
new-democratic revolution aims at wiping out only feudalism and monopoly
capitalism, only the landlord class and the bureaucrat-capitalist class (the
big bourgeoisie), and not at wiping out capitalism in general, the upper
petty bourgeoisie or the middle bourgeoisie. In view of China's economic
backwardness, even after the country-wide victory of the revolution, it will
still be necessary to permit the existence for a long time of a capitalist
sector of the economy represented by the extensive upper petty bourgeoisie
and middle bourgeoisie. In accordance with the division of labour in the
national economy, a certain development of all parts of this capitalist sector
which are beneficial to the national economy will still be needed. This
capitalist sector will still be an indispensable part of the whole national
economy. The upper petty bourgeoisie referred to here are small industrialists
and merchants employing workers or assistants. In addition, there are also
great numbers of small independent craftsmen and traders who employ no workers
or assistants and, needless to say, they should be firmly protected. After
the victory of the revolution all over the country, the new-democratic state
will possess huge state enterprises taken over from the bureaucrat-capitalist
class and controlling the economic lifelines of the country, and there will
be an agricultural economy liberated from feudalism which, though it will
remain basically scattered and individual for a fairly long time, can later
be led to develop, step by step, in the direction of co-operatives. In these
circumstances the existence and development of these small and middle capitalist
sectors will present no danger. The same is true of the new rich peasant
economy which will inevitably emerge in the rural areas after the land reform.
It is absolutely impermissible to repeat such wrong ultra-Left polices towards
the upper petty bourgeois and middle bourgeois sectors in the economy as
our Party adopted during 1931-34 (unduly advanced labour conditions, excessive
income tax rates, encroachment on the interests of industrialists and merchants
during the land reform, and the adoption as a goal of the so-called "workers'
welfare", which was a short-sighted and one-sided concept, instead of the
goal of developing production, promoting economic prosperity, giving
consideration to both public and private interests and benefiting both labour
and capital). To repeat such mistakes would certainly damage the interests
both of the working masses and of the new-democratic state. One of the provisions
in the Outline Land Law of China reads, "The property and lawful business
of industrialists and merchants shall be protected from encroachment."
"Industrialists and merchants" refers to all small independent craftsmen
and traders as well as all small and middle capitalist elements. To sum up,
the economic structure of New China will consist of: (1) the state-owned
economy, which is the leading sector; (2) the agricultural economy, developing
step by step from individual to collective; and (3) the economy of small
independent craftsmen and traders and the economy of small and middle private
capital. These constitute the whole of the new-democratic national economy.
The principles guiding the new-democratic national economy must closely conform
to the general objective of developing production, promoting economic prosperity,
giving consideration to both public and private interests and benefiting
both labour and capital. Any principle, policy or measure that deviates from
this general objective is wrong.

The People's Liberation Army issued a manifesto in October 1947 which stated
in part<B>: </B>
<P>
Unite workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals and businessmen, all oppressed
classes, all people's organizations, democratic parties, minority nationalities,
overseas Chinese and other patriots; form a national united front; overthrow
the dictatorial Chiang Kai-shek government; and establish a democratic coalition
government.
<P>
That is the fundamental political programme of the People's Liberation Army
and of the Communist Party of China. On the surface, our revolutionary national
united front appears to have narrowed in the present period as compared with
the period of the War of Resistance. As a matter of fact, it has been precisely
in the present period, after Chiang Kai-shek sold out the nation's interests
to U.S. imperialism and launched the country-wide civil war against the people
and after the crimes of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek
clique were completely exposed before the Chinese people, that our national
united front has really broadened. During the War of Resistance, Chiang Kai-shek
and the Kuomintang were not yet completely discredited among the Chinese
people and were still able to deceive them in many ways. Now it is different;
all their deceptions have been shown up by their own deeds, they no longer
have any mass following, they are completely isolated. In contrast to the
Kuomintang, the Communist Party of China not only has the confidence of the
broadest masses of the people in the Liberated Areas but has also won the
support of the broad masses in the areas and big cities under Kuomintang
control. If in 1946 a section of the upper petty bourgeois and middle bourgeois
intellectuals under Chiang Kai-shek's rule still cherished the idea of a
so-called third road,<B>[<A href="#bm9">9</A>]</B> this idea is now bankrupt.
Because our Party adopted a thoroughgoing land policy, it has won whole-hearted
support from much broader masses of peasants than during the War of Resistance.
As a result of U.S. imperialist aggression, Chiang Kai-shek's oppression
and our Party's correct policy of firmly protecting the interests of the
masses, our Party has won the sympathy of the broad masses of the working
class, the peasantry and the urban petty and middle bourgeoisie in Chiang
Kai-shek's areas. Driven by hunger, political oppression and Chiang Kai-shek's
civil war against the people, which has made life impossible, the masses
have been waging incessant struggles against U.S. imperialism and Chiang
Kai-shek's reactionary government; their basic slogans are against hunger,
against persecution, against civil war and against U.S. interference in China's
internal affairs. Never before has their awakening reached such a level,
neither before nor during the War of Resistance, nor in the period immediately
after the Japanese surrender. That is why we say that our new-democratic
revolutionary united front is now broader and more consolidated than ever.
This development is not only linked with our land and urban policies but
is also closely linked with the whole political situation-with the victories
of the People's Liberation Army, with Chiang Kai-shek's turn from the offensive
to the defensive, with the People's Liberation Army's turn from the defensive
to the offensive, with the period of a new high tide in the Chinese revolution.
Realizing that Chiang Kai-shek's regime is inevitably doomed, people now
place their hopes on the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation
Army, and this is quite natural. Without the broadest united front of the
overwhelming majority of the population, it will be impossible to win victory
in China's new-democratic revolution. Moreover, this united front must be
under the firm leadership of the Communist Party of China. Without the Party's
firm leadership, no revolutionary united front can win victory. When the
Northern Expedition reached its climax in 1927, the capitulationists in our
Party's leading body voluntarily gave up the Party's leadership of the peasant
masses, urban petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie, and in particular
gave up the Party's leadership of the armed forces, thus causing the defeat
of the revolution. During the War of Resistance, our Party combated ideas
similar to those of the capitulationists, that is, such ideas as making
concessions to the Kuomintang's anti-popular policies, having more confidence
in the Kuomintang than in the masses, not daring to arouse and give full
rein to mass struggles, not daring to expand the Liberated Areas and the
people's armies in the Japanese-occupied areas, and handing over the leadership
in the War of Resistance to the Kuomintang. Our Party waged a resolute struggle
against such impotent and degenerate ideas, which run counter to the principles
of Marxism-Leninism, resolutely carried out its political line of "developing
the progressive forces, winning over the middle forces and isolating the
die-hard forces" and resolutely expanded the Liberated Areas and the People's
Liberation Army. This ensured not only that our Party was able to defeat
Japanese imperialism in the period of its aggression, but also that, in the
period after the Japanese surrender when Chiang Kai-shek launched his
counter-revolutionary war, our Party was able to switch smoothly and without
loss to the course of opposing Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary war
with a people's revolutionary war and to win great victories in a short time.
All Party comrades must keep these lessons of history firmly in mind.


<h4>
<B>VIII</B></h4>
<P>
When the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique launched the country-wide civil
war against the people in 1946, the reason they dared take this risk was
that they relied not merely on their own superior military strength but mainly
on the U.S. imperialists with their atom bombs, whom they regarded as
"exceptionally powerful" and "matchless in the world". On the one hand, they
thought U.S. imperialism could meet their military and financial needs with
a stream of supplies. On the other hand, they wildly speculated that "war
between the United States and the Soviet Union is inevitable" and that "the
outbreak of a third world war is inevitable". This dependence on U.S. imperialism
is the common feature of the reactionary forces in all countries since World
War II. It reflects the severity of the blows world capitalism received in
World War II; it reflects the weakness of the reactionary forces in all
countries, their panic and loss of confidence; and it reflects the might
of the world revolutionary forces -- all of which make reactionaries in all
countries feel that there is no way out except to rely on U.S. imperialist
support. But, in fact, is U.S. imperialism after World War II as powerful
as Chiang Kai-shek and the reactionaries of other countries imagine? Can
it really pour out a stream of supplies for them? No, that is not so. The
economic power of U.S. imperialism, which grew during World War II, is confronted
with unstable and daily shrinking domestic and foreign markets. The further
shrinking of these markets will cause economic crises to break out. The war
boom in the United States of America was only temporary. The strength of
the United States of America is only superficial and transient. Irreconcilable
domestic and international contradictions, like a volcano, menace U.S.
imperialism every day. U.S. imperialism is sitting on this volcano. This
situation has driven the U.S. imperialists to draw up a plan for enslaving
the world, to run amuck like wild beasts in Europe, Asia and other parts
of the world, to muster the reactionary forces in all countries, the human
dregs cast off by their peoples, to form an imperialist and anti-democratic
camp against all the democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union, and to
prepare for war in the hope that in the future, at a distant time, some day,
they can start a third world war to defeat the democratic forces. This is
a preposterous plan. The democratic forces of the world must defeat this
plan and certainly can defeat it. The strength of the world anti-imperialist
camp has surpassed that of the imperialist camp. It is we, not the enemy,
who are in the superior position. The anti-imperialist camp headed by the
Soviet Union has already been formed. The socialist Soviet Union is free
from crises, on the ascendant and cherished by the world's broad masses;
its strength has already surpassed that of the imperialist United States,
which is seriously menaced by crises, on the decline and opposed by the world's
broad masses. The People's Democracies in Europe are consolidating themselves
internally and are uniting with each other. In the European capitalist countries
the people's anti-imperialist forces are developing, with those in France
and Italy taking the lead. Within the United States, there are people's
democratic forces which are getting stronger every day. The peoples of Latin
America are not slaves obedient to U.S. imperialism. In the whole of Asia
a great national liberation movement has arisen. All the forces of the
anti-imperialist camp are uniting and forging ahead. The Communist and Workers'
Parties of nine European countries have established their Information Bureau
and issued a call to the people of the world to rise against the imperialist
plan of enslavement.<B>[<A href="#bm10">10</A>]</B> This call to battle has
inspired the oppressed people of the world, charted the course of their struggle
and strengthened their confidence in victory. It has thrown world reaction
into panic and confusion. All the anti-imperialist forces in the countries
of the East, too, should unite together, oppose oppression by imperialism
and by their domestic reactionaries and make the goal of their struggle the
emancipation of the more than 1,000 million oppressed people of the East.
We certainly should grasp our own destiny in our own hands. We should rid
our ranks of all impotent thinking. All views that overestimate the strength
of the enemy and underestimate the strength of the people are wrong. If everyone
makes strenuous efforts, we, together with all the democratic forces of the
world, can surely defeat the imperialist plan of enslavement, prevent the
outbreak of a third world war, overthrow all reactionary regimes and win
lasting peace for mankind. We are soberly aware that on our way forward there
will still be all kinds of obstacles and difficulties and that we should
be prepared to deal with the maximum resistance and desperate struggle by
all our enemies, domestic and foreign. But so long as we can grasp the science
of Marxism-Leninism, have confidence in the masses, stand closely together
with the masses and lead them forward, we shall be fully able to surmount
any obstacle and overcome any difficulty. Our strength will be invincible.
This is the historic epoch in which world capitalism and imperialism are
going down to their doom and world socialism and people's democracy are marching
to victory. The dawn is ahead, we must exert ourselves.

<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm4">4.</A> The National Land Conference of the Communist Party
of China was held in September 1947 in Hsipaipo Village, Pingshan County,
Hopei Province. The Outline Land Law of China, adopted by the conference
on September 13, was published by the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China on October 10, 1947. It stipulated the following<B>: </B>
<blockquote>
Abolish the land system of feudal and semi-feudal exploitation and put into
effect the system of land to the tillers.
</blockquote><blockquote>
All the land of the landlords and the public land in the villages is to be
taken over by the local peasant associations and, together with all other
land there, is to be equally distributed among the entire rural population,
regardless of sex or age.
</blockquote><blockquote>
The peasant associations of the villages shall take over the draught animals
farm tools, houses, grain and other property of the landlords, requisition
the surplus of such property of the rich peasants, distribute all this property
among the peasants and other poor people who are in need of it and allot
the same share to the landlords.
</blockquote><blockquote>
Thus the Outline Land Law not only confirmed the principle of "confiscation
of the land of the landlords and its distribution among the peasants" laid
down in the "May 4th Directive" of 1946 but also made up for the lack of
thoroughness in that directive, which had shown too much consideration for
certain landlords.</blockquote>
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm5">5.</A> Subsequently in the implementation some changes were
made in the method of equal distribution of land provided in the Outline
Land Law of China. In February 1948 the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China specified in its "Directive on the Work of Land Reform and
of Party Consolidation in the Old and Semi-Old Areas that in the old and
semi-old Liberated Areas where the feudal system had already been overthrown,
there would be no further equal distribution of land, but that the poor peasants
and farm labourers who had not yet completely shaken off the feudal yoke
should, if circumstances so required, be given a certain amount of land and
other means of production through readjustment, by the method of taking from
those who had a surplus and giving to those who had a shortage and taking
from those who had better and giving to those who had worse, while the middle
peasants would be allowed to keep more land than the average poor peasant.
In areas where the feudal system still existed, equal distribution was confined
mainly to the land and property of landlords and the surplus land and property
of old-type rich peasants. In all areas, it was permissible to take the surplus
land of middle peasants and new-type rich peasants for purposes of readjustment
only if this was actually necessary and if the owners really consented. In
the land reform in the new Liberated Areas, no land was to be taken from
any middle peasant.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm6">6.</A> The question of the rich peasants in China's land reform
was a peculiar one arising from her specific historical and economic conditions.
China's rich peasants differed from those in many capitalist countries in
two respects: first, they generally and to a great degree had the character
of feudal and semi-feudal exploiters and, second, this rich peasant economy
did not occupy an important place in the country's agricultural economy.
In the struggle against feudal exploitation by the landlord class in China,
the broad masses of poor peasants and farm labourers also demanded the abolition
of feudal and semi-feudal exploitation by the rich peasants. During the War
of Liberation, the Communist Party of China adopted the policy of requisitioning
the surplus land and property of rich peasants for distribution among the
peasants, and thus satisfied the demands of the masses of poor peasants and
farm labourers and ensured victory in the People's War of Liberation. As
the war progressed towards victory, the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China in February 1948 laid down new policies for the land reform
in the new Liberated Areas. The reform was to be divided into two stages:
in the first stage, neutralize the rich peasants and concentrate the blows
on the landlords, primarily the big landlords; in the second stage, while
distributing the land of the landlords, also distribute the land rented out
by rich peasants and their surplus land, but continue to treat the rich peasants
differently from the landlords (see "Essential Points in Land Reform in the
New Liberated Areas", pp. 201-02 of this volume). After the founding of the
People's Republic of China, the Central People's Government in June 1950
promulgated the Land Reform Law, which provided that in the land reform only
the land rented out by the rich peasants should partly or wholly be
requisitioned, while the rest of their land and property was to be protected.
In the subsequent stage of socialist revolution, the rich peasant economy
disappeared as the movement for agricultural co-operation deepened and the
rural economy developed.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm7">7.</A> That is to say, a rich peasant household owned on the
average more and better land than a poor peasant household. Taking the country
as a whole, the quantity of the means of production owned by China's rich
peasants and the volume of their farm produce were both very small. The rich
peasant economy did not occupy an important place in China's rural economy.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm8">8.</A> This refers to the movement for rectifying the style
of work conducted by the Communist Party of China in 1942-43 throughout the
Party; its content was the combating of subjectivism, sectarianism and
stereotyped writing. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-tung, this
rectification movement adopted the principles of "learning from past mistakes
to avoid their repetition, curing the sickness to save the patient" and "clearing
up wrong thinking while uniting with comrades". Through the method of criticism
and self-criticism, the movement corrected the "Left" and Right errors which
had occurred on various occasions in the history of the Party by getting
down to their ideological roots, greatly raised the ideological level of
the broad ranks of Party cadres, helped immensely to unify thinking within
the Party on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and thus brought about a high
degree of unity in the whole Party.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm9">9.</A> In the early stage of the People's War of Liberation
some democratic personages fancied that they could find a so-called third
road, apart from the Kuomintang dictatorship of big landlords and big bourgeoisie
and apart from the people's democratic dictatorship led by the Communist
Party of China. This third road was in fact the road of a dictatorship of
the bourgeoisie on the British and U.S. pattern.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm10">10.</A> The Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers'
Parties was founded at a meeting held in Warsaw, Poland, in September 1947
by representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Bulgaria, Rumania,
Hungary, Poland, the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, Italy and Yugoslavia.
Later, at a meeting in Rumania in June 1948, the Bureau announced the expulsion
of the Yugoslav Communist Party because the latter persisted in its
anti-Marxist-Leninist stand and adopted an attitude opposed to the Soviet
Union and the socialist camp. The Information Bureau's call to the people
of the world to rise against the imperialist plan of enslavement, mentioned
here by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, was the "Declaration on the International
Situation" adopted at the September 1947 meeting of the Information Bureau.
