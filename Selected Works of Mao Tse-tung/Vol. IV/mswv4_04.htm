A spokesman for Chiang Kai-shek, commenting on the alleged violation by the
Communist Party of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's order to Commander-in-Chief
Chu Teh, said at a press conference in Chungking on the afternoon of August
15, "The orders of the generalissimo must be obeyed" and "Those who violate
them are enemies of the people." A Hsinhua News Agency correspondent states:
This is an open signal by Chiang Kai-shek for all-out civil war. On August
11, at the critical moment when the Japanese invaders were being finally
wiped out, Chiang Kai-shek issued an order of national betrayal forbidding
the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army and all the other armed forces
of the people to fight the Japanese and the puppet troops. Of course, this
order cannot and should not be accepted. Soon afterwards, Chiang Kai-shek
through his spokesman proclaimed the armed forces of the Chinese people to
be "enemies of the people". This shows that Chiang Kai-shek has declared
civil war against the Chinese people. Chiang Kai-shek's plotting of civil
war did not of course begin with his order of August 11; it has been his
consistent plan throughout the eight years of the War of Resistance. During
those eight years, Chiang Kai-shek launched three large-scale anti-Communist
campaigns, in 1940, 1941 and 1943,
<STRONG>[<A href="#bm1">1</A>]</STRONG> each time attempting to develop the
attack into a country-wide civil war, and only the opposition of the Chinese
people and of public figures in the Allied countries prevented its occurrence,
much to Chiang's regret. Thus he was forced to postpone the country-wide
civil war until the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and so came
the order of August and the statement of August 15. For the purpose of unleashing
civil war, Chiang Kai-shek had already invented many terms, such as "alien
party", "traitor party", "traitor army", "rebel army", "traitor areas", "bandit
areas", "disobedience to military and government orders", "feudal separatism",
"undermining the War of Resistance" and "endangering the state"; and he had
alleged that, since in the past there had been only "suppression of Communists"
in China and not "civil war", there would be no "civil war" in the future
either, and so on and so forth. The slight difference this time is the addition
of a new term, "enemy of the people". But people will perceive that this
is a foolish invention. For whenever the term, "enemy of the people", is
used in China, everyone knows who is meant. There is a person in China who
betrayed Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles<STRONG>
[<A href="#bm2">2</A>]</STRONG> and the Great Revolution of 1927. He plunged
the Chinese people into the bloodbath of ten years of civil war and thereby
invited aggression by Japanese imperialism. Then, scared out of his wits,
he took to his heels and led a flock of people in a flight all the way from
Heilungkiang to Kweichow Province. He became an onlooker and sat around,
waiting with folded arms for victory to come. Now that victory has come,
he tells the people's armies to "stay further orders" and tells the enemy
and the traitors to "maintain order" so that he can swagger back to Nanking.
One need only mention these facts for the Chinese people to know that this
person is Chiang Kai-shek. After all he has done, can there be any dispute
as to whether Chiang Kai-shek is an enemy of the people? Dispute there is.
The people say "Yes". The enemy of the people says "No". And that is the
only dispute. Among the people it is becoming less and less a matter of dispute.
The problem now is that this enemy of the people wants to start a civil war.
What are the people to do? The Hsinhua News Agency correspondent says: The
policy of the Communist Party of China in regard to Chiang Kai-shek's launching
a civil war is clear and consistent, namely, to oppose it. As far back as
the time when Japanese imperialism began to invade China, the Communist Party
of China demanded an end to civil war and unity against foreign aggression.
In 1936-37 the Party made tremendous efforts, forced Chiang Kai-shek to accept
its proposal and so carried out the War of Resistance Against Japan. During
the eight years of resistance, the Communist Party of China never once relaxed
its efforts to alert the people to check the danger of civil war. Since last
year, the Communist Party has time and again called the people's attention
to the huge plot being hatched by Chiang Kai-shek to unleash a country-wide
civil war as soon as the War of Resistance ended. The Communist Party, like
the rest of the Chinese people in the world concerned for peace in China,
holds that a new civil war would be a calamity. But the Communist Party maintains
that civil war can still be prevented and must be prevented. It is in order
to prevent civil war that the Communist Party has advocated the formation
of a coalition government. Now Chiang Kai-shek has rejected this proposal,
and so civil war is touch-and-go. But there is definitely a way of checking
this move of Chiang Kai-shek's. The people's democratic forces must strive
to expand resolutely and rapidly; the people must liberate the big cities
under enemy occupation and disarm the enemy and puppet troops; and if an
autocrat and traitor to the people dares to attack them, the people must
act in self-defence and resolutely strike back to frustrate the designs of
the instigator of civil war. That is the way, the only way. The Hsinhua News
Agency correspondent calls on the whole nation and the whole world to repudiate
the utterly hypocritical and shameless lie which asserts that, on the contrary,
civil war in China can be averted if Chiang Kai-shek forbids the Chinese
people to liberate the enemy-occupied big cities, forbids them to disarm
enemy and puppet forces and forbids them to establish democracy, if he himself
goes to these big cities to "inherit" (not to smash) enemy and puppet regimes.
This is a lie, the Hsinhua News Agency correspondent points out, and this
lie obviously runs counter to the national and democratic interests of the
Chinese people and also in the face of all the facts of modern Chinese history.
It must always be remembered that it was not because the big cities were
in the hands of the Communist Party rather than in his own hands that Chiang
Kai-shek waged the ten-year civil war from 1927 to 1937; on the contrary,
since 1927 none of the big cities has been in the hands of the Communist
Party but all have been in Chiang's hands or have been yielded by him to
the Japanese and the traitors, and this is the very reason why the civil
war lasted for ten years on a country-wide scale and has continued on a local
scale to this day. It must always be remembered that the ten-year civil war
was stopped and that the three large-scale anti-Communist campaigns and countless
other provocations during the War of Resistance were checked (up to and including
Chiang Kai-shek's recent invasion of the southern part of the
Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region
<STRONG>[<A href="#bm3">3</A>]</STRONG>) not because Chiang Kai-shek was
strong, but on the contrary because Chiang was relatively not strong enough,
while the Communist Party and the people were relatively strong. The ten-year
civil war was stopped, not by the appeals of public figures throughout the
country who desired peace and feared war (such as those of the former "League
for Banning Civil War"<STRONG>[<A href="#bm4">4</A>]</STRONG> and similar
bodies), but by the armed demand of the Communist Party of China and the
armed demands of the Northeastern Army under Chang Hsueh-liang and the
Northwestern Army under Yang Hu-cheng.
<STRONG>[<A href="#bm5">5</A>]</STRONG> The three large-scale anti-Communist
campaigns and countless other provocations were not beaten back by unlimited
concessions and submission by the Communist Party, they were beaten back
by the Communist Party's persistence in a just, stern attitude of self-defence
-- "We will not attack unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will
certainly counter-attack." <STRONG>[<A href="#bm6">6</A>]</STRONG> If the
Communist Party had been utterly powerless and spineless and had not fought
to the finish for the interests of the nation and the people, how could the
ten-year civil war have been ended? How could the War of Resistance Against
Japan have started? And even though started, how could it have been carried
on resolutely until victory today? How else could Chiang Kai-shek and his
ilk be alive now, issuing orders and making statements from a mountain retreat
so far from the front lines? The Communist Party of China is firmly opposed
to civil war. The Soviet Union, the United States and Britain declared in
the Crimea, "establish conditions of internal peace" and "form interim
governmental authorities broadly representative of all democratic elements
in the population and pledged to the earliest possible establishment through
free elections of governments responsive to the will of the
people".<STRONG>[<A href="#bm7">7</A>]</STRONG> That is exactly what the
Communist Party of China has persistently advocated -- the formation of a
"coalition government". The carrying out of this proposal can prevent civil
war. But there is one precondition -- strength. If people unite and increase
their strength, civil war can be prevented.

<A NAME="bm2">2</A>. The Three People's Principles were the principles and
programmes put forward by Sun Yat-sen on the questions of nationalism, democracy
and people's livelihood in the bourgeois democratic revolution in China.
In 1924, in the Manifesto of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang,
a congress characterized by co-operation between the Kuomintang and the Communist
Party, Sun Yat-sen restated the Three People's Principles, interpreted
nationalism as opposition to imperialism and expressed active support for
the movements of the workers and peasants. The old Three People's Principles
thus developed into the new Three People's Principles with the Three Great
Policies, that is, alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist
Party and assistance to the peasants and workers. The new Three People's
Principles provided the political basis for the co-operation between the
Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang during the First Revolutionary
Civil War period.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm3">3</A>. This refers to the attack in July 1945 by Kuomintang
troops on Chunhua, Hsunyi and Yaohsien in the Kuanchung sub-region of the
Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. See "The Situation and Our Policy After
the Victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan", Note 12, p. 24 of this
volume.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm4">4</A>. The "League for Banning Civil War" was formed in Shanghai
in August 1932 with a mainly bourgeois membership. It issued a declaration
calling for "ending the civil war and uniting to resist foreign aggression".

<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm5">5</A>. In 1936 the Kuomintang's Northeastern Army headed by
Chang Hsueh-liang and the Kuomintang's Northwestern Army headed by Yang Hu-cheng
were stationed in and around Sian; they were charged with the task of attacking
the Chinese Red Army which had arrived in northern Shensi. Influenced by
the Chinese Red Army and the people's anti-Japanese movement, they agreed
to the Anti-Japanese National United Front put forward by the Communist Party
of China and demanded that Chiang Kai-shek unite with the Communist Party
to resist Japan. Chiang Kai-shek turned down the demand, became even more
active in his military preparations for the "suppression of the Communists"
and massacred the anti-Japanese youth of Sian. Chang Hsueh-liang and Yang
Hu-cheng took joint action and arrested Chiang Kai-shek. This was the famous
Sian Incident of December 12, 1936. Chiang Kai-shek was forced to accept
the terms of unity with the Communist Party and resistance to Japan and was
then set free to return to Nanking.
