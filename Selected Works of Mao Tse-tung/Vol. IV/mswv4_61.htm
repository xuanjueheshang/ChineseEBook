  <B>ORDER TO THE ARMY FOR THE COUNTRY-WIDE ADVANCE</B>
</H1>
<p class="title">
<EM>April 21, 1949</EM>
<P ALIGN=center>
<P class="information">
[This order was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung. After the reactionary Kuomintang
government refused to sign the Agreement on Internal Peace, the People's
Liberation Army acted on this order issued by Chairman Mao Tse-tung and
Commander-in-Chief Chu Teh and embarked upon a general advance, unprecedented
in scale, into the vast areas which had not yet been liberated. On the morning
of April 21, 1949, the Second Field Army led by Liu Po-cheng, Teng Hsiao-ping
and other comrades and the Third Field Army led by Chen Yi, Su Yu, Tan Chen-lin
and other comrades, forced the Yangtse River on a front extending more than
five hundred kilometres from Hukou (northeast of Kiukiang) in the west to
Kiangyin in the east and completely destroyed the defence line along the
Yangtse which the enemy had painstakingly built in three and a half months.
On April 23 these forces liberated Nanking, which had been the centre of
the counter-revolutionary rule of the Kuomintang for twenty-two years, and
proclaimed the downfall of the reactionary Kuomintang regime. Then they thrust
south along separate routes, liberated Hangchow on May 3 and Nanchang on
May 22 and captured Shanghai, China's biggest city, on May 27. In June they
began their march into Fukien Province; they liberated Foochow on August
17 and Amoy on October 17. On May 14 the Fourth Field Army led by Lin Piao,
Lo Jung-huan and other comrades forced the Yangtse on a front of more than
one hundred kilometres in the Tuanfeng-Wuhsueh sector east of Wuhan. On May
16 and 17 it liberated Wuchang, Hanyang and Hankow, cities of strategic
importance in central China. Then it marched south into Hunan. Cheng Chien,
Kuomintang governor of Hunan Province, and Chen Mingjen, Commander of the
1st Army renounced their allegiance to the Kuomintang on August 4, and Hunan
Province was peacefully liberated. The Fourth Field Army fought the
Hengyang-Paoching campaign in September and October, wiped out the main force
of the Kuomintang troops under Pai Chung-hsi and then pushed on to Kwangtung
and Kwangsi Provinces. It liberated Canton on October 14, Kweilin on November
22 and Nanning on December 4. While the Second and Third Field Armies were
forcing the Yangtse River, the armies in northern China led by Nieh Jung-chen,
Hsu Hsiang-chien and other comrades captured Taiyuan on April 24, 1949. The
First Field Army led by Peng Teh-huai, Ho Lung and other comrades, after
liberating Sian on May 20, continued its march into the Kuomintang areas
in the Northwest together with two armies from northern China. They captured
Lanchow on August 26, liberated Sining on September 5 and Yinchuan on September
23 and completely annihilated the Kuomintang troops under Ma Pu-fang and
Ma Hung-kuei. Late in September Tao Chih-yueh, Kuomintang Garrison
Commander-in-Chief of Sinkiang Province, and Burhan, the governor, renounced
their allegiance to the Kuomintang, and Sinkiang was peacefully liberated.
At the beginning of November the Second Field Army led by Liu Po-cheng, Teng
Hsiao-ping and other comrades, together with the 18th Army of the Northern
China Field Army and part of the First Field Army led by Ho Lung, Li Ching-chuan
and other comrades, began their march into southwestern China. They liberated
Kweiyang on November 15 and Chungking on November 30. On December 9 Lu Han,
Kuomintang governor of Yunnan Province, Liu Wen-hui, Kuomintang governor
of Sikang Province, and Teng Hsi-hou and Pan Wen-hua, deputy directors of
the Kuomintang Bureau of Military and Administrative Affairs in the Southwest,
renounced their allegiance to the Kuomintang, and the two provinces of Yunnan
and Sikang were peacefully liberated. In late December the People's Liberation
Army which had entered the Southwest fought the Chengtu campaign, completely
wiped out the Kuomintang troops under Hu Tsung-nan and liberated Chengtu
on December 27. By the end of December 1949 the People's Liberation Army
had wiped out all the Kuomintang troops on China's mainland and liberated
the entire mainland except Tibet.]

Comrade commanders and fighters of all field armies, comrades of the People's

<P>
The Agreement on Internal Peace, drafted after long negotiations between
the delegation of the Communist Party of China and the delegation of the
Nanking Kuomintang government, has been rejected by that
government.<B>[<A href="#bm1">1</A>]</B> The responsible members of the Nanking
Kuomintang government have rejected the agreement because they are still
obeying the orders of U.S. imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, the chieftain
of the Kuomintang bandit gang, and because they are trying to block the progress
of the cause of the Chinese people's liberation and prevent the internal
problem from being solved by peaceful means. The Agreement on Internal Peace,
comprising eight sections with twenty-four articles formulated by the two
delegations in the negotiations, is lenient on the problem of war criminals,
is lenient towards the Kuomintang officers, soldiers and government personnel
and provides appropriate solutions for other problems, all proceeding from
the interests of the nation and the people. The rejection of this agreement
shows that the Kuomintang reactionaries are determined to fight to the finish
the counter-revolutionary war which they started. The rejection of this agreement
shows that in proposing peace negotiations on January 1 of this year the
Kuomintang reactionaries were only trying to check the advance of the People's
Liberation Army and thus gain a breathing space for a later comeback to crush
the revolutionary forces. The rejection of this agreement shows that the
Li Tsung-jen government at Nanking was utterly hypocritical in professing
to accept the Chinese Communist Party's eight terms for peace as the basis
for negotiations. Inasmuch as the Li Tsung-jen government had already accepted
such fundamental terms as the punishment of war criminals, the reorganization
of all the reactionary Kuomintang troops on democratic principles and the
handing over of all power and authority by the Nanking government and its
subordinate governments at all levels, it had no reason to reject the specific
measures which were drawn up on the basis of these fundamental terms and
which are most lenient. In these circumstances, we order you as follows<B>:
</B>
<P>
1. Advance bravely and annihilate resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely
all the Kuomintang reactionaries within China's borders who dare to resist.
Liberate the people of the whole country. Safeguard China's territorial
integrity, sovereignty and independence.
<P>
2. Advance bravely and arrest all the incorrigible war criminals. No matter
where they may flee, they must be brought to justice and punished according
to law. Pay special attention to arresting the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek.
<P>
3. Proclaim to all Kuomintang local governments and local military groups
the final amended version of the Agreement on Internal Peace. In accordance
with its general ideas, you may conclude local agreements with those who
are willing to cease hostilities and to settle matters by peaceful means.
<P>
4. After the People's Liberation Army has encircled Nanking, we are willing
to give the Li Tsung-jen government at Nanking another opportunity to sign
the Agreement on Internal Peace, if that government has not yet fled and
dispersed and desires to sign it.

  <I>NOTES</I>
</H4>

<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm1">1.</A> On April 1, 1949, the Kuomintang government delegation
headed by Chang Chih-chung arrived in Peiping to negotiate peace with the
delegation of the Communist Party of China. An Agreement on Internal Peace
was drafted after a half month of negotiations. The agreement (final amended
version) was handed to the Nanking government delegation by the delegation
of the Communist Party of China on April 15 and was rejected by the Nanking
government on April 20. The full text of the agreement (final amended version)
is as follows<B>: </B>
<p class="indentb">
In the 35th year of the Republic of China, the National Government at Nanking,
with the aid of the Government of the United States of America, defied the
will of the people, wrecked the truce agreement and the resolutions of the
Political Consultative Conference and, on the pretext of opposing the Communist
Party of China, launched a country-wide civil war against the Chinese people
and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This war has lasted two years and
nine and a half months. It has brought untold disaster to the people throughout
the country. The country has suffered tremendous losses of financial and
material resources, and its sovereignty has been further infringed. The people
of the whole country have always expressed dissatisfaction with the National
Government at Nanking for its violation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary
Three People's Principles and of his correct policies of alliance with Russia,
co-operation with the Communist Party and assistance to the peasants and
workers, and for its violation of his revolutionary testament. In particular,
the whole people have voiced their opposition to the launching of the present
unprecedented large-scale civil war by the National Government at Nanking
and to the erroneous political, military, financial, economic, cultural and
foreign policies and measures which that government has adopted in its pursuit
of the civil war. The National Government at Nanking has completely forfeited
the confidence of the entire people. In the present civil war its troops
have already been defeated by the People's Liberation Army led by the Communist
Party of China and commanded by the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military
Commission. Finding itself in this situation, the National Government at
Nanking proposed to the Communist Party of China on January 1 of the 38th
year of the Republic of China that negotiations should be held for the cessation
of the civil war and the restoration of peace. On January 14 of the same
year, the Communist Party of China issued a statement agreeing to this proposal
of the Kuomintang government at Nanking and putting forward eight terms as
the basis for the peace negotiations between the two sides. These terms are
as follows: punish the war criminals; abolish the bogus constitution; abolish
the bogus "constituted authority"; reorganize all reactionary troops on
democratic principles; confiscate bureaucrat-capital; reform the land system;
abrogate treasonable treaties; convene a New Political Consultative Conference
without the participation of reactionary elements and form a democratic coalition
government to take over all the power and authority of the reactionary Nanking
Kuomintang government and of its subordinate governments at all levels. These
eight basic terms were agreed to by the National Government at Nanking.
Thereupon, the Communist Party of China and the National Government at Nanking
appointed their respective delegations, fully empowered to conduct negotiations
and to sign an agreement. The delegates of both parties met in Peiping, have
affirmed first of all that the National Government at Nanking should bear
the full responsibility for the present civil war and for all its erroneous
policies and have agreed to conclude this agreement. 
<h4>
<B>SECTION ONE</B> </h4>

<p class="indentb">
Article 1. In order to distinguish between right and wrong and to establish
responsibility, the delegation of the Communist Party of China and the delegation
of the National Government at Nanking (hereinafter referred to as both sides)
affirm that, as a matter of principle, punishment shall be meted out to the
war criminals of the National Government at Nanking who are held responsible
for launching and prosecuting the present civil war, but that they will be
dealt with on the merits of each case in accordance with the following
conditions<B>:</B>
<p class="indentc">
  Item 1. All war criminals, no matter who they are, may be cleared of the
  charge of being war criminals and treated with leniency, provided they show
  by actual deeds that they are really sincere in distinguishing right from
  wrong and are determined to make a clean break with their past, thus facilitating
  the progress of the cause of the Chinese people's liberation and the peaceful
  settlement of the internal problem.
<p class="indentc">
  Item 2. All incorrigible war criminals, no matter who they are, shall be
  severely punished if they obstruct the progress of the cause of the people's
  liberation, hinder the peaceful settlement of the internal problem, or go
  so far as to instigate rebellion. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military
  Commission will be responsible for suppressing the ringleaders of rebellion.
<p class="indentb">
Article 2. Both sides affirm that the National Government at Nanking was
wrong in pronouncing General Yasuji Okamura, war criminal in the Japanese
aggression against China, not guilty and releasing him on January 26 of the
38th year of the Republic of China and in granting permission on January
31 of the same year for the repatriation to Japan of 260 other Japanese war
criminals. The cases of all these Japanese war criminals shall be reopened

and the allocation of the posts of chairmen and vice-chairmen shall be the
same as in the national reorganization committee. A reorganization committee
shall be established for the navy and another for the air force. All matters
relating to the People's Liberation Army's entry into, and taking over of,
