  TWO TELEGRAMS FROM THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE EIGHTEENTH GROUP TO CHIANG
  KAI-SHEK
</H1>
<p class="title">
<EM>August 1945</EM>
<P class="information">
[These telegrams were written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Commander-in-Chief
of the Eighteenth Group Army. At that time, when the Japanese aggressors
had announced their surrender but had not yet actually surrendered, the Chiang
Kai-shek government, with the armed assistance of U.S. imperialism, monopolized
the right to accept the Japanese surrender and was actively preparing a
counterrevolutionary civil war by sending large forces to advance on the
Liberated Areas on the pretext of accepting the Japanese surrender. Comrade
Mao Tse-tung's purpose in writing the first telegram was to unmask the
counter-revolutionary face of Chiang Kai-shek and teach the whole people
to be on guard against his civil war plot. The second telegram further exposed
the plot of the Chiang Kai-shek clique for preparing civil war and put forward
the six-point proposal of the Communist Party of China for preventing civil
war. For the same purpose, Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote for the Hsinhua News
Agency two commentaries, "Chiang Kai-shek Is Provoking Civil War" and "On
a Statement by Chiang Kai-shek's Spokesman", which are included in this volume.
Owing to the firm, determined stand of the Communist Party of China in refusing
to be cowed by Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary bluster, both the Liberated
Areas and the Liberation Army expanded quickly; and, under strong political
pressure from the forces at home and abroad opposed to civil war in China,
Chiang Kai-shek had to change his tactics, assume a posture of peace and
invite Comrade Mao Tse-tung to Chungking for peace negotiations.]

<h4>
  <B>I. TELEGRAM OF AUGUST 13 </B>
</h4>
<P>
We have received through the Chungking radio two Central News Agency dispatches,
one carrying the order you sent us and the other your order to the officers
and men in various war zones. Your order to us reads, "All units of the
Eighteenth Group Army should stay where they are, pending further orders."
In addition, it talks about such things as forbidding us to take over the
enemy's arms. Your order to the officers and men in various war zones was
reported as follows in the Central News Agency dispatch from Chungking, dated
August 11:<B> </B>"The Supreme Command today sent telegrams to the officers
and men in various war zones, ordering them to step up the war effort and
in accordance with existing military plans and orders actively to push forward
without the slightest relaxation." We hold that these two orders contradict
each other. According to the first, our units should "stay where they are,
pending further orders" and should no longer attack or fight. Why do you
tell us not to fight at this moment when the Japanese aggressors have not
yet actually surrendered, when every hour and every minute they are killing
Chinese people and fighting Chinese troops as well as Soviet, U.S. and British
troops, and when, in their turn, the Soviet, U.S. and British troops are
fighting the Japanese aggressors every hour and every minute? As to the second
order, we consider it very good. "Step up the war effort and actively push
forward without the slightest relaxation" -- that's more like it! But what
a pity you have given this order only to your own troops, and not to us,
and that you have given us something quite different. Chu Teh issued an order
on August 10 to all anti-Japanese armed forces in China's Liberated Areas
<B>[<A href="#bm1">1</A>]</B> precisely to the effect that they should "step
up the war effort". His order said further that while stepping up their war
effort they must order the Japanese aggressors to surrender to them and must
take over the arms and other equipment of the enemy and puppet troops. Isn't
this very good? Undoubtedly it is very good; undoubtedly it is in the interest
of the Chinese nation. But to "stay where they are, pending further orders"
is definitely not in the national interest. We hold that you have given a
wrong order, an order so wrong that we have to inform you we firmly reject
it. For your order to us is not only unjust but also runs counter to China's
national interest and benefits only the Japanese aggressors and the traitors
to the motherland.
<h4>
  <B>II. TELEGRAM OF AUGUST 16</B>
</h4>
<P>
At a time when our common enemy, the Japanese government, has accepted the
terms of the Potsdam Declaration and already announced its surrender but
has not yet actually surrendered, I hereby address to you the following statement
and demands on behalf of all the anti-Japanese armed forces and all the 260
million people in China's Liberated Areas and Japanese-occupied areas.
<P>
With the War of Resistance Against Japan coming to a victorious close, I
call your attention to this fact in the China war theatre today, namely,
that in the vast occupied areas abandoned by you and seized by the enemy
and puppets we have, against your will, by our eight years of bitter fighting
recaptured nearly 1,000,000 square kilometres of territory; liberated over
100,000,000 people; organized over 1,000,000 regular troops and over 2,200,000
people's militia; established nineteen large Liberated Areas in the nineteen
provinces of Liaoning, Jehol, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hopei, Shansi, Shensi, Kansu,
Ningsia, Honan, Shantung, Kiangsu, Anhwei, Hupeh, Hunan, Kiangsi, Chekiang,
Fukien and Kwangtung;<B> [<A href="#bm2">2</A>]</B> and encircled most of
the cities and towns, vital communication lines and sections of the sea coast
seized by the enemy and puppets since the July 7th Incident of 1937,
<B>[<A href="#bm3">3</A>] </B>except in a few areas. In addition, in China's
Japanese-occupied areas (with a population of 160 million) we have organized
extensive underground forces to strike at the enemy and puppets. In the fighting
we are continuing to resist and encircle 69 per cent of the Japanese troops
invading China (not counting those in the Northeast) and 95 per cent of the
puppet troops. Your government and armed forces, on the contrary, have all
along followed a policy of looking on with folded arms, sitting around and
waiting for victory, conserving your forces and preparing for civil war,
and have not only refused recognition and supplies to our Liberated Areas
and armies but encircled and attacked us with a huge force of 940,000 men.
Although all the troops and civilians in China's Liberated Areas have suffered
enough from being attacked by the enemy and puppet forces on the one side
and by your troops on the other, we have never in the least weakened in our
determination to persevere in the War of Resistance, in unity and in democracy.
The people of China's Liberated Areas and the Communist Party of China have
proposed many times to you and your government that a conference of all parties
be convened and that a democratic coalition government of the whole country
be formed in order to stop internal strife, mobilize and unite the people's
anti-Japanese forces throughout China, lead the War of Resistance to victory
and ensure peace after the war. But our proposals have invariably been rejected
by you and your government. We are extremely dissatisfied with all this.
<P>
The enemy country will soon sign its surrender, but you and your government
have continued to ignore our opinions, issued a most outrageous order to
me on August 11 and ordered your troops to press against the Liberated Areas
on a large scale under the pretext of disarming the enemy; the danger of
civil war is therefore more serious than ever. All of which compels us to
make the following demands on you and your government:<B> </B>
<P>
1. I demand that you consult with us, so that we may reach common views before
you, your government and your Supreme Command accept the surrender of the
Japanese and the puppets and conclude any post-surrender agreements or treaties.
For you and your government have aroused the dissatisfaction of the people
and cannot represent the broad masses or any of the people's anti-Japanese
armed forces in China's Liberated Areas and Japanese-occupied areas. We reserve
our right to speak out, if the agreements or treaties include, without our
prior consent, anything that concerns the people's anti-Japanese armed forces
in China's Liberated Areas and Japanese-occupied areas.
<P>
2. All the people's anti-Japanese armed forces in China's Liberated Areas
and Japanese-occupied areas have the right, in accordance with the Potsdam
Declaration and the measures laid down by the Allies for accepting the enemy
surrender,<B> [<A href="#bm4">4</A>]</B> to accept the surrender of the Japanese
and puppet troops encircled by us, take over their arms and mat&eacute;riel
and assume the responsibility for carrying out all stipulations laid down
by the Allies after Japan's surrender has been accepted. On August 10 I ordered
the armed forces of China's Liberated Areas to make all efforts to attack
the enemy troops and be prepared to accept their surrender. On August 15,
I ordered the enemy commander-in-chief, Yasuji Okamura, to surrender with
his troops,<B> [<A href="#bm5">5</A>]</B> this order, however, applies only
to the sphere of operations armed forces of the Liberated Areas, and not
to any other. I consider my orders very reasonable and very much in the common
interest of China and the Allies.
<P>
3. The broad masses and all the anti-Japanese armed forces in China's Liberated
Areas and Japanese-occupied areas have the right to send their representatives
to participate in the Allies' acceptance of the enemy surrender and in the
work of dealing with the enemy country after its surrender.
<P>
4. China's Liberated Areas and all the anti-Japanese armed forces have the
right to select their own delegation to participate in the future peace
conference concerned with Japan and any United Nations meetings.
<P>
5. I ask you to prevent civil war. The way to do this is for the armed forces
of the Liberated Areas to accept the surrender of the enemy and puppet troops
they have encircled, while your armed forces accept the surrender of the
enemy and puppet troops you have encircled. Not only is this the established
practice in all wars, it is particularly imperative in order to avert civil
war. If you act otherwise, it will lead to adverse consequences. I am now
giving you a serious warning on this matter and I ask you not to treat this
warning casually.
<P>
6. I ask you immediately to abolish the one-party dictatorship, call a conference
of all parties to set up a democratic coalition government, dismiss corrupt
officials and all reactionaries from their posts, punish the traitors, abolish
the secret services, recognize the legal status of the various parties (the
Communist Party of China and all democratic parties have up to now been regarded
as illegal by you and your government), annul all reactionary laws and decrees
that suppress the liberties of the people, recognize the popularly elected
governments and the anti-Japanese armed forces of China's Liberated Areas,
withdraw the troops encircling the Liberated Areas, release political prisoners
and carry out economic and other democratic reforms.
<P>
Apart from this, I sent you a telegram on August 13 in reply to your order
to me of August 11, and presumably you have received it. I now declare again,
your order was completely wrong. On August 11 you ordered my troops to "stay
where they are, pending further orders" and not to attack the enemy any more.
However, not only was it true on August 11, but it is equally true even today
(August 16) that the Japanese government has surrendered only in words, and
not in deeds; no instrument of surrender has been signed, no actual surrender
has taken place. My view is completely in accord with that of the Allies,
Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union. On August 11, the very day
you issued your order to me, the British Army Command on the Burma front
announced that the war with Japan was still in progress. Nimitz,
<B>[<A href="#bm6">6</A>]</B> the commander of the U.S. forces, declared
that not only did a state of war continue but the war with all its devastating
consequences must be carried on. The Far Eastern Command of the Red Army
of the Soviet Union announced, "The enemy must be ruthlessly smashed." On
August 15, Colonel-General Antonov, Chief of the General Staff of the Red
Army, made the following statement<B>: </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The message concerning Japan's surrender issued by the Japanese Emperor on
  August 14 is only a general declaration concerning unconditional surrender.
  The order to the armed forces to cease hostilities has not yet been issued
  and the Japanese troops are continuing their resistance. Hence there is still
  no actual surrender by the armed forces of Japan. The surrender of the armed
  forces of Japan can be considered to have taken place only from the moment
  the Japanese Emperor orders his armed forces to discontinue hostilities and
  lay down their arms and when this order is carried out in practice. In view
  of the above, the armed forces of the Soviet Union in the Far East will continue
  their offensive operations against Japan.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It can be seen that you alone, of all the high commanders of the Allied forces,
have given an absolutely wrong order. I consider that your error stems from
your self-seeking and is of an extremely serious nature; that is to say,
your order serves the interest of the enemy. Therefore, taking my stand on
the common interest of China and the Allies, I shall firmly and completely
oppose your order so long as you do not openly admit your error and countermand
this wrong order. At present I am still ordering the armed units under my
command to make determined attacks on the enemy, in co-ordination with armed
forces of the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain, the enemy actually
stops hostilities and surrenders his arms and all the territory of the motherland
has been fully recovered. I declare to you, I am a patriotic soldier, I cannot
act otherwise.
<P>
With regard to the above I request your early reply.

of the Chinese people's heroic War of Resistance Against Japan which lasted
for eight years.

"all the Japanese military, naval and air authorities" and "all the forces
under their control wherever located" must "cease active operations" and
"surrender their arms".
