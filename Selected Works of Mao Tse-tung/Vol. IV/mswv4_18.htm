  <B>ON THE TEMPORARY ABANDONMENT OF YENAN AND THE DEFENCE OF THE
  SHENSI-KANSU-NINGSIA BORDER REGION</B>
</H1>
<p class="title">
<B> TWO DOCUMENTS ISSUED BY THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
OF CHINA</B> 
<P class="title">
<EM>November 1946 and April 1947</EM>
<P class="information">
[The first of these two documents was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung in
Yenan in the winter of 1946 when Kuomintang troops were preparing to attack
that city, and the second at Chingyangcha, Hengshan County, northern Shensi,
twenty days after Kuomintang troops occupied Yenan on March 19, 1947. After
the bankruptcy of Chiang Kai-shek's plan for an all-out offensive against
the Liberated Areas, he adopted frantic measures to save his dying regime,
convened a bogus National Assembly, expelled the representatives of the Communist
Party of China from the Kuomintang areas and launched an attack on Yenan,
the seat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. As these
documents pointed out, the outcome of Chiang Kai-shek's measures was his
complete self-destruction politically. Militarily he concentrated his forces
on the eastern and western flanks of the Liberated Areas that is, the Shantung
Liberated Area and the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Liberated Area in an attempt
to carry out "attacks against key sectors"; and again the outcome was complete
failure. The Kuomintang troops attacking the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border
Region were more than 230,000 strong, while the Northwest People's Liberation
Army had only some 20,000 in that region. Therefore the enemy forces were
able to occupy Yenan and all the region's county towns, which we abandoned
on our own initiative. The enemy, however, failed to achieve his objective
of destroying the headquarters of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China and the Northwest People's Liberation Army or of driving them
east of the Yellow River. On the contrary, he suffered many heavy blows from
our army, lost about 100,000 men and finally had to flee in confusion from
the Border Region, while our army triumphantly went over to the offensive
for the liberation of the Great Northwest. Moreover, our army in the Northwest
theatre, employing a very small force, pinned down and destroyed large numbers
of the enemy's main force, and thereby strongly supported the operations
of our troops in other theatres, particularly in the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan
theatre, and helped them go over more quickly to the offensive. Comrade Mao
Tse-tung, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General
Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army remained in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia
Border Region the whole time from March 1947, when our army withdrew from
Yenan, to a year later when we went over to the offensive in the Northwest
theatre. This fact was of great political significance. It greatly inspired
and strengthened the will to fight and the confidence in victory of the army
and the people in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and in other Liberated
Areas throughout the country. While in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region,
Comrade Mao Tse-tung not only continued to direct the People's War of Liberation
on all fronts throughout the country but also took personal command in the
Northwest theatre and successfully achieved the aim set forth in the present
document, "defend and expand the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and the
Liberated Areas in the Northwest with a firm fighting spirit". Concerning
the operations in the Northwest theatre see "The Concept of Operations for
the Northwest War Theatre", pp. 133-34 and "On the Great Victory in the Northwest
and on the New Type of Ideological Education Movement in the Liberation Army",
pp. 211-17, of this volume.]

<h4>I. DIRECTIVE OF NOVEMBER 18, 1946</h4>

<P>
Chiang Kai-shek is at the end of his rope. He wants to strike at our Party
and strengthen himself by two methods, by convening the "National Assembly"
and by attacking Yenan. Actually, he will accomplish the very opposite. The
Chinese people resolutely oppose the "National Assembly" stage-managed by
Chiang Kai-shek to split the nation; the opening day of that assembly marked
the beginning of the self-destruction of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Now
that we have wiped out thirty-five brigades[<A href="#bm1">1</A>] of Chiang
Kai-shek's troops and their offensive power is nearly exhausted, even if
his troops should occupy Yenan by means of a sudden thrust, it would not
damage the general prospect of victory in the People's War of Liberation,
nor could it save Chiang Kai-shek from the doom awaiting him. In short, Chiang
Kai-shek has taken the road to ruin; as soon as he makes these two moves
of convening the "National Assembly" and attacking Yenan, all his trickery
will be exposed, this will help the progress of the People's War of Liberation.
In every area we should fully explain to people inside and outside the Party
these two actions of Chiang Kai-shek, the convening of the "National Assembly"
and the attack on Yenan, and unite the whole Party, the whole army and the
whole people in the fight to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and build
a democratic China. 

<h4>II. CIRCULAR OF APRIL 9, 1947 </h4> 

<P>
In order to save its moribund regime, the Kuomintang, besides taking such
steps as convening the bogus National Assembly, drawing up the bogus
constitution, driving out the representative agencies of our Party from Nanking,
Shanghai and Chungking and proclaiming a break between the Kuomintang and
the Communist Party,[<A href="#bm2">2</A>] has taken the further step of
attacking Yenan, the seat of our Party's Central Committee and the General
Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, and of attacking the
Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region.
<P>
The fact that the Kuomintang has taken these steps does not in the least
indicate that its regime is strong but rather that the crisis of the Kuomintang
regime has become extremely deep. Its attack on Yenan and the
Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region is moreover a vain attempt to settle the
Northwest question first, cut off our Party's right arm, drive our Party's
Central Committee and the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation
Army from the Northwest, then move its troops to attack northern China and
so achieve the objective of defeating our forces one by one.
<P>
In these circumstances, the Central Committee has decided as follows:
<P>
1. We must defend and expand the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and the
Liberated Areas in the Northwest with a firm fighting spirit; it is entirely
possible to achieve this objective.
<P>
2. The Central Committee of our Party and the General Headquarters of the
People's Liberation Army must remain in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region.
It is an area where we have a favourable mountainous terrain, a good mass
base, plenty of room for manoeuvre, and full guarantee for security
<P>
3. At the same time, to facilitate our work, we have set up a Working Committee
of the Central Committee to proceed to north western Shansi or some other
suitable place to carry out the tasks entrusted to it by the Central Committee.
<P>
These three decisions were made last month and have already been put into
effect. You are hereby notified.

<A NAME="bm1">1.</A> The statistics were for the period from early July to
November 13, 1946.
<P class="information">
<A NAME="bm2">2.</A> On February 27-28, 1947, the representatives and personnel
of the Chinese Communist Party stationed in Nanking, Shanghai and Chungking
for negotiations and liaison were forced by the Kuomintang government to
leave within a stated time. On March 15, 1947, the Central Executive Committee
of the Kuomintang convened its third plenary session, at which Chiang Kai-shek
proclaimed the Kuomintang's break with the Communist Party and his determination
to fight the civil war to the finish.
