  INTRODUCING <EM>THE COMMUNIST</EM>
</H1>
<p class="title">
<EM>October 4, 1939</EM>
<P>
The Central Committee has long planned to publish an internal Party journal,
and now at last the plan has materialized. Such a journal is necessary for
building up a bolshevized Chinese Communist Party, a party which is national
in scale and has a broad mass character, a party which is fully consolidated
ideologically, politically and organizationally. This necessity is all the
more obvious in the present situation, which has special features: on the
one hand, the danger of capitulation, of a split and of retrogression within
the Anti-Japanese National United Front is increasing daily, while on the
other, our Party has stepped out of its narrow confines and become a major
national party. The duty of the Party is to mobilize the masses to overcome
the dangers of capitulation, a split and retrogression and prepare against
all possible eventualities so that in case they occur, the Party and the
revolution will not suffer unexpected losses. An internal Party journal is
indeed most necessary at a time like this.
<P>
This internal Party journal is called <EM>The Communist. </EM>What is its
purpose? What will it deal with? In what way will it differ from other Party
publications?
<P>
Its purpose is to help build a bolshevized Chinese Communist Party which
is national in scale, has a broad mass character, and is fully consolidated
ideologically, politically and organizationally. The building of such a party
is imperative for the victory of the Chinese revolution and on the whole
the subjective and objective conditions for it are present; indeed this great
undertaking is now in progress. A special Party periodical is needed to help
achieve this great task, which is beyond the capability of an ordinary Party
publication, and this is why <EM>The Communist </EM>is<EM> </EM>now being
published.
<P>
To a certain extent our Party is already national in scale and has a broad
mass character: and it is already a bolshevized party, consolidated
ideologically, politically and organizationally, so far as its core of
leadership, a part of its membership and its general line and revolutionary
work are concerned.
<P>
That being so, why set a new task?
<P>
The reason is that we now have many new branches, which have a great many
new members but which cannot yet be considered as having a broad mass character,
as being ideologically, politically and organizationally consolidated, or
as being bolshevized. At the same time, there is the problem of raising the
political level of the older Party members and of making further progress
in bolshevizing the older branches and consolidating them ideologically,
politically and organizationally. The circumstances in which the Party now
finds itself and the responsibilities it is shouldering are quite unlike
those in the revolutionary civil war period; the circumstances are much more
complex and the responsibilities much heavier.
<P>
This is the period of the national united front, and we have formed a united
front with the bourgeoisie; this is the period of the War of Resistance Against
Japan, and the armed forces of our Party are at the front, fighting a ruthless
war against the enemy in co-ordination with the friendly armies; this is
the period when our Party has become a major national party and is therefore
no longer what it was before. If we take all these factors together, we shall
understand how glorious and momentous is the task we have set ourselves,
the task of "building up a bolshevized Chinese Communist Party, a party which
is national in scale and has a broad mass character, a party fully consolidated
ideologically, politically and organizationally".
<P>
It is this kind of party that we now want to build, but how shall we go about
it? We cannot answer this question without going into the history of our
Party and of its eighteen years of struggle.
<P>
It is fully eighteen years since our First National Congress in 1921. In
these eighteen years our Party has gone through many great struggles. And
the members of the Party, its cadres and organizations, have all tempered
themselves in these great struggles. They have had the experience both of
splendid victories and grave defeats in the revolution. The Party established
a national united front with the bourgeoisie and, with the break-up of this
united front, engaged in a bitter armed struggle with the big bourgeoisie
and its allies. During the last three years, it has again entered into a
period of a national united front with the bourgeoisie. It is through this
kind of complex relationship with the Chinese bourgeoisie that the Chinese
revolution and the Communist Party of China have progressed in their development.
This is a special historical feature, a feature peculiar to the revolution
in colonial and semi-colonial countries and not to be found in the revolutionary
history of any capitalist country. Moreover, since China is a semi-colonial
and semi-feudal country, since her political, economic and cultural development
is uneven, since her economy is predominantly semi-feudal and since her territory
is vast, it follows that the character of the Chinese revolution in its present
stage is bourgeois-democratic, that its principal targets are imperialism
and feudalism and that its basic motive forces are the proletariat, the peasantry
and the urban petty bourgeoisie, with the national bourgeoisie taking part
at certain times and to a certain extent; it also follows that the principal
form of struggle in the Chinese revolution is armed struggle. Indeed, the
history of our Party may be called a history of armed struggle. Comrade Stalin
has said, "In China the armed revolution is fighting the armed
counter-revolution. That is one of the specific features and one of the
advantages of the Chinese revolution."<B>[<A HREF="#bm1">1</A>]</B> This
is perfectly true. The specific feature peculiar to semi-colonial China is
not present, or is not present in the same way, in the history of the revolutions
led by Communist Parties in the capitalist countries. Thus, there are two
basic specific features in the Chinese bourgeois-democratic revolution: (1)
the proletariat either establishes a revolutionary national united front
with the bourgeoisie, or is forced to break it up; and (2) armed struggle
is the principal form of the revolution. Here we do not describe the Party's
relations with the peasantry and the urban petty bourgeoisie as a basic specific
feature, first, because these relations are in principle the same as those
which confront Communist Parties all over the world, and secondly, because
armed struggle in China is, in essence, peasant war and the Party's relations
with the peasantry and its close relations with the peasant war are one and
the same thing.
<P>
It is because of these two basic specific features, in fact precisely because
of them, that the building up and bolshevization of our Party are proceeding
in special circumstances. The Party's failures or successes, its retreats
or advances, its contraction or expansion, its development and consolidation
are inevitably linked up with its relations with the bourgeoisie and with
armed struggle. When the Party takes a correct political line on the question
of forming a united front with the bourgeoisie or of breaking it up when
forced to do so, our Party moves a step forward in its development, consolidation
and bolshevization; but when it takes an incorrect line on its relations
with the bourgeoisie, then our Party moves a step backward. Similarly, when
our Party handles the question of revolutionary armed struggle correctly,
it moves a step forward in its development, consolidation and bolshevization;
but when it handles the question incorrectly, it moves a step backward. Thus,
for eighteen years, the building and bolshevization of the Party have been
closely linked with its political line, with the correct or incorrect handling
of the questions of the united front and armed struggle. This conclusion
is clearly confirmed by the eighteen years of our Party's history. Or conversely,
the more bolshevized the Party, the more correctly can it decide upon its
political line and handle the questions of the united front and armed struggle.
This conclusion, too, is clearly confirmed by the eighteen years of our Party's
history.
<P>
Therefore the united front, armed struggle and Party building are the three
fundamental questions for our Party in the Chinese revolution. Having a correct
grasp of these three questions and their interrelations is tantamount to
giving correct leadership to the whole Chinese revolution. We are now able
to draw correct conclusions concerning these three questions by virtue of
our abundant experience in the eighteen years of our Party's history, our
rich and profound experience of failures and successes, retreats and advances,
contraction and expansion. This means that we are now able to handle the
questions of the united front, of armed struggle and of Party building in
a correct way. It also means that our eighteen years of experience have taught
us that the united front, armed struggle and Party building are the Chinese<B>
</B>Communist Party's three "magic weapons", its<B> </B>three principal magic
weapons for defeating the enemy in the Chinese revolution. This is a great
achievement of the Chinese Communist Party and of the Chinese revolution.
<P>
Here let us briefly discuss each of the three magic weapons, each of the
three questions.
<P>
In the last eighteen years, the united front of the Chinese proletariat with
the bourgeoisie and other classes has developed under three different sets
of circumstances or through three different stages: the First Great Revolution
from 1924 to 1927, the War of Agrarian Revolution from 1927 to 1937, and
the present War of Resistance Against Japan. The history of the three stages
has confirmed the following laws<B>:</B>
<p class="quote">
  (1) The Chinese national bourgeoisie will take part in the struggle against
  imperialism and the feudal warlords at certain times and to a certain extent,
  because foreign oppression is the greatest oppression to which China is
  subjected. Therefore, at such times, the proletariat should form a united
  front with the national bourgeoisie and maintain it as far as possible. (2)
  In other historical circumstances, the Chinese national bourgeoisie will
  vacillate and defect because of its economic and political flabbiness. Therefore
  the composition of China's revolutionary united front will not remain constant
  at all times, but is liable to change. At one time the national bourgeoisie
  may take part in it, at another it may not. (3) The Chinese big bourgeoisie,
  which is comprador in character, is a class which directly serves imperialism
  and is fostered by it. Hence the comprador Chinese big bourgeoisie has always
  been a target of the revolution. However, different groups within this big
  bourgeoisie are backed by different imperialist powers, so that when
  contradictions among these powers become sharper and when the edge of the
  revolution is mainly directed against a particular power, the big bourgeois
  groups dependent upon the other powers may join the struggle against that
  particular imperialist power to a certain extent and for a certain time.
  At such times, in order to weaken the enemy and add to its own reserves,
  the Chinese proletariat may form a united front with these groups and should
  maintain it as far as possible, provided it is advantageous to the revolution.
  (4) The comprador big bourgeoisie continues to be most reactionary even when
  it joins the united front alongside the proletariat in struggling against
  the common enemy. It stubbornly opposes any ideological, political and
  organizational development of the proletariat and the proletarian party,
  tries to impose restrictions on them and employs disruptive tactics such
  as deception, blandishments, "corrosion" and savage attacks against them;
  moreover, it does all this to prepare for capitulating to the enemy and splitting
  the united front. (5) The peasantry is the firm ally of the proletariat.
  (6) The urban petty bourgeoisie is a reliable ally.
</P>
<P>
The validity of these laws was confirmed during the First Great Revolution
and the Agrarian Revolution, and it is being confirmed again in the present
War of Resistance. Therefore, in forming a united front with the bourgeoisie
(and especially with the big bourgeoisie), the party of the proletariat must
carry on a stern and resolute struggle on two fronts. On the one hand, it
is necessary to combat the error of neglecting the possibility that the
bourgeoisie may join in the revolutionary struggle at certain times and to
a certain extent. It is an error of "Left" closed-doorism to regard the
bourgeoisie in China as being the same as in the capitalist countries, and
consequently to neglect the policy of forming a united front with the bourgeoisie
and maintaining it for as long as possible. On the other hand, it is also
necessary to combat the error of identifying the programme, policy ideology,
practice, etc. of the proletariat with those of the bourgeoisie, and neglecting
the differences in principle between them. The error here consists in neglecting
the fact that the bourgeoisie (and especially the big bourgeoisie) not only
exerts an influence on the petty bourgeoisie and the peasantry, but does
its utmost to influence the proletariat and the Communist Party in a strenuous
effort to destroy their ideological, political and organizational independence,
turn them into an appendage of the bourgeoisie and its political party, and
ensure that it will reap the fruits of the revolution for itself or its political
party alone; this error also consists in neglecting the fact that the bourgeoisie
(and especially the big bourgeoisie) betrays the revolution whenever the
revolution conflicts with its own selfish interests or with those of its
own political party. To neglect all this is Right opportunism. The characteristic
feature of Chen Tu-hsiu's Right opportunism was that it led the proletariat
to accommodate itself to the selfish interests of the bourgeoisie and its
political party, and this was the subjective cause of the failure of the
First Great Revolution. The dual character of the Chinese bourgeoisie in
the bourgeois-democratic revolution exerts a great effect on our political
line and our Party building, and without grasping this dual character we
cannot have a good grasp of our political line or of Party building. One
important component of the political line of the Chinese Communist Party
is the policy both of unity with the bourgeoisie and of struggle against
it. In fact, the development and tempering of the Party through its unity
and struggle with the bourgeoisie are an important component of Party building.
Unity here means the united front with the bourgeoisie. Struggle here means
the "peaceful" and "bloodless" struggle, ideological, political and
organizational, which goes on when we are united with the bourgeoisie and
which turns into armed struggle when we are forced to break with it. If our
Party does not understand that it must unite with the bourgeoisie in certain
periods, it cannot advance and the revolution cannot develop; if our Party
does not understand that it must wage a stern and resolute "peaceful" struggle
against the bourgeoisie while uniting with it, then our Party will disintegrate
ideologically, politically and organizationally and the revolution will fail;
and if our Party does not wage a stern and resolute armed struggle against
the bourgeoisie when forced to break with it, our Party will likewise
disintegrate and the revolution will likewise fail. The truth of all this
has been confirmed by the events of the past eighteen years.
<P>
Armed struggle by the Chinese Communist Party takes the form of peasant war
under proletarian leadership. The history of this armed struggle, too, falls
into three stages. The first was the stage in which we took part in the Northern
Expedition. Our Party had already begun to realize the importance of armed
struggle, but did not understand it fully, it did not understand that armed
struggle was the principal form of struggle in the Chinese revolution. The
second stage was the War of the Agrarian Revolution. By that time our Party
had already built up its own independent armed forces, learned the art of
fighting independently, and established people's political power and base
areas. Our Party was already able to achieve direct or indirect co-ordination
of armed struggle, the principal form of struggle, with many other necessary
forms, that is, to co-ordinate it on a national scale with the workers' struggle,
the peasants' struggle (which was the main thing), the struggle of the youth,
the women and all other sections of the people, the struggle for political
power, the struggles on the economic, the anti-espionage and the ideological
fronts, and other forms of struggle. And this armed struggle was the peasant
agrarian revolution under the leadership of the proletariat. The third stage
is the present stage, the War of Resistance. In this stage we are able to
turn to good account our experience of armed struggle in the first and especially
the second stage, and our experience of co-ordinating armed struggle with
all other necessary forms of struggle. In general, armed struggle at the
present time means guerrilla warfare.<B>[<A HREF="#bm2">2</A>]</B> What is
guerrilla warfare? It is the indispensable and therefore the best form of
struggle for the people's armed forces to employ over a long period in a
backward country, a large semi-colonial country, in order to inflict defeats
on the armed enemy and build up their own bases. So far both our political
line and our Party building have been closely linked with this form of struggle.
It is impossible to have a good understanding of our political line and,
consequently, of our Party building in isolation from armed struggle, from
guerrilla warfare. Armed struggle is an important component of our political
line. For eighteen years our Party has gradually learned to wage armed struggle
and has persisted in it. We have learned that without armed struggle neither
the proletariat, nor the people, nor the Communist Party would have any standing
at all in China and that it would be impossible for the revolution to triumph.
In these years the development, consolidation and bolshevization of our Party
have proceeded in the midst of revolutionary wars; without armed struggle
the Communist Party would assuredly not be what it is today. Comrades throughout
the Party must never forget this experience for which we have paid in blood.
<P>
Similarly, there have been three distinct stages in the building up of the
Party, its development, consolidation and bolshevization.
<p class="quote">
  The first stage was the Party's infancy. In the early and middle phases of
  this stage the Party's line was correct and the revolutionary zeal both of
  the rank and file and of the cadres was exceedingly high; hence the victories
  in the First Great Revolution. But after all, ours was then still an infant
  Party, it lacked experience concerning the three basic problems of the united
  front, armed struggle and Party building, it did not have much knowledge
  of Chinese history and Chinese society or of the specific features and laws
  of the Chinese revolution, and it lacked a comprehensive understanding of
  the unity between the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the
  Chinese revolution. Hence in the last phase of this stage, or at the critical
  juncture of this stage, those occupying a dominant position in the Party's
  leading body failed to lead the Party in consolidating the victories of the
  revolution and, as a result, they were deceived by the bourgeoisie and brought
  the revolution to defeat. The Party organizations expanded in this stage
  but they were not consolidated, and they failed to help Party members and
  cadres become firm and stable ideologically and politically. There were plenty
  of new members but they were not given the necessary Marxist-Leninist education.
  There was also abundant experience in work, but it was not summed up properly.
  Many careerists sneaked into the Party, but they were not combed out. The
  Party was caught in a maze of schemes and intrigues both of enemies and of
  allies, but it lacked vigilance. Within the Party, activists came forward
  in great numbers, but they were not turned into the mainstay of the Party
  in good time. The Party had some revolutionary armed units under its command,
  but it was unable to keep a tight grip on them. The reasons for all this
  were inexperience, insufficient depth of revolutionary understanding, and
  ineptitude in integrating the theory of Marxism-Leninism with the practice
  of the Chinese revolution. Such was the first stage of Party building.
  <P>
  The second stage was the War of the Agrarian Revolution. Our Party was able
  to wage a successful agrarian revolutionary struggle for ten years because
  of the experience it had gained in the first stage, because of its better
  understanding of Chinese history and society and of the specific features
  and laws of the Chinese revolution, and because its cadres had a better grasp
  of the theory of Marxism-Leninism and were better able to integrate it with
  the practice of the Chinese revolution. Although the bourgeoisie had turned
  traitor, our Party was able to rely firmly on the peasantry. The Party
  organization not only grew afresh but also became consolidated. Day in day
  out the enemy tried to sabotage our Party, but the Party drove out the saboteurs.
  Once again large numbers of cadres came forward in the Party, and this time
  they became its mainstay. The Party blazed the trail of people's political
  power and thus learned the art of government. The Party created strong armed
  forces and thus learned the art of war. These were momentous advances and
  achievements. Nevertheless, in the course of these great struggles some of
  our comrades sank into the quagmire of opportunism, or did so at least for
  a time, and again the reasons were that they did not learn modestly from
  the experience of the past, did not acquire an understanding of Chinese history
  and society and of the specific features and laws of the Chinese revolution,
  and did not have an understanding of the unity between the theory of
  Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution. Hence throughout
  this stage certain people who held leading positions in the Party failed
  to adhere to correct political and organizational lines. At one time the
  Party and the<B> </B>revolution were damaged by Comrade Li Li-san's "Left"
  opportunism, at another by "Left" opportunism in the revolutionary war and
  in the work in the White areas. Not until the Tsunyi Meeting (the meeting
  of the Political Bureau at Tsunyi, Kweichow, in January 1935) did the Party
  definitively take the road of bolshevization and lay the foundations for
  its subsequent victory over Chang Kuo-tao's Right opportunism and for the
  establishment of an anti-Japanese national united front. This was the second
  stage in the Party's development.
  <P>
  The third stage is that of the Anti-Japanese National United Front. We have
  been in this stage for three<B> </B>years now and these years of struggle
  are extremely important. Drawing on its experience in the two preceding
  revolutionary stages, on its organizational strength and the strength of
  its armed forces, on its high political prestige among the people of the
  whole country, and on its deeper understanding of the unity between the theory
  of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution, our Party
  has not only established the Anti-Japanese National United Front but has
  also been conducting the great War of Resistance Against Japan. Organizationally,
  it has stepped out of its narrow confines and become a major national party.
  Its armed forces are again growing and are becoming still stronger in the
  struggle against the Japanese aggressors. Its influence among the whole people
  is becoming more extensive. These are all great achievements. However, many
  of our new Party members have not yet been given education, many of the new
  organizations have not yet been consolidated, and there is still a vast
  difference between them and the older members and organizations. Many of
  the new Party members and cadres have not yet had sufficient revolutionary
  experience. They still know little or nothing about Chinese history and society
  or about the specific features and laws of the Chinese revolution. Their
  understanding of the unity between the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the
  practice of the Chinese revolution is far from being comprehensive. During
  the expansion of the Party's organizations, a good many careerists and enemy
  saboteurs did succeed in sneaking in despite the fact that the Central Committee
  stressed the slogan "Expand the Party boldly, but do not let a single undesirable
  in". Although the united front was formed and has been maintained for three
  years now, the bourgeoisie, and especially the big bourgeoisie, has constantly
  been trying to destroy our Party, the big bourgeois capitulators and die-hards
  have been instigating serious friction throughout the country, and the
  anti-Communist clamour is incessant. All this is being used by the big bourgeois
  capitulators and die-hards to prepare the way for capitulating to Japanese
  imperialism, breaking up the united front and dragging China backwards.
  Ideologically, the big bourgeoisie is trying to "corrode" communism, whilst
  politically and organizationally it is trying to liquidate the Communist
  Party, the Border Region and the Party's armed forces. In these circumstances
  it is undoubtedly our task to overcome the dangers of capitulation, a split
  and retrogression, to maintain the national united front and Kuomintang-Communist
  co-operation as far as possible, to work for continued resistance to Japan
  and continued unity and progress, and at the same time to prepare against
  all possible eventualities so that in case they occur, the Party and the
  revolution will not suffer unexpected losses. To this end, we must strengthen
  the Party's organization and its armed forces, and mobilize the whole people
  for resolute struggle against capitulation, a split and retrogression. The
  accomplishment of this task depends upon the efforts of the whole Party,
  upon the unrelenting and persistent struggle of all Party members, cadres
  and organizations everywhere and at every level. We are confident that the
  Chinese Communist Party with its eighteen years of experience will be able
  to achieve these objectives by the joint efforts of its experienced older
  members and cadres and its vigorous and youthful newer members and cadres,
  by the joint efforts of its well-tried bolshevized Central Committee and
  its local organizations, and by the joint efforts of its powerful armed forces
  and the progressive masses.
</P>
<P>
We have set out the principal experiences and principal problems of our Party
in its eighteen years of history.
<P>
Our eighteen years of experience show that the united front and armed struggle
are the two basic weapons for defeating the enemy. The united front is a
united front for carrying on armed struggle. And the Party is the heroic
warrior wielding the two weapons, the united front and the armed struggle,
to storm and shatter the enemy's positions. That is how the three are related
to each other.
<P>
How are we to build up our Party today? How can we build up "a bolshevized
Chinese Communist Party, a party which is national in scale and has a broad
mass character, a party which is fully consolidated ideologically, politically
and organizationally"? The answer can be found by studying the Party's history,
by studying Party building in Connection with the united front and armed
struggle, in connection with the problem of both uniting and struggling with
the bourgeoisie, and with that of persistence in guerrilla warfare against
Japan by the Eighth Route and the New Fourth Armies and the establishment
of anti-Japanese base areas.
<P>
To sum up our eighteen years of experience and our current new, experience
on the basis of our understanding of the unity between the theory of
Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution, and to spread
this experience throughout the Party, so that our Party becomes as solid
as steel and avoids repeating past mistakes-- such is our task.

<p class="information">
<A name="bm2">2.</A> In saying that in general, armed struggle in the Chinese
revolution means guerrilla warfare, Comrade Mao Tse-tung is summing up China's
experience of revolutionary war from the Second Revolutionary Civil War to
the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the long period
of the Second Revolutionary Civil War, all the armed struggles led by the
Chinese Communist Party took the form of guerrilla warfare. In the latter
phase of that period, as the strength of the Red Army grew, guerrilla warfare
changed into mobile warfare of a guerrilla character which, as Comrade Mao
Tse-tung defines it, is guerrilla warfare on a higher level. But in the War
of Resistance Against Japan, with a different enemy and in different
circumstances, there was a shift back to guerrilla warfare. In the early
days of the anti-Japanese war, those Party comrades who committed the error
of Right opportunism belittled the guerrilla warfare led by the Party and
pinned their hopes on the operations of the Kuomintang army. Comrade Mao
Tse-tung refuted their views in his "Problems of Strategy in Guerrilla War
Against Japan", "On Protracted War" and "Problems of War and Strategy", and
in the present article he gave a theoretical summing-up of the experience
gained in waging the prolonged armed struggle of the Chinese revolution which
took the form of guerrilla warfare. In the latter stage of the anti-Japanese
war, and more particularly in the period of the Third Revolutionary Civil
War (1945--49), guerrilla warfare changed into regular warfare as the main
form of armed struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party,
and this was due to the further growth of the revolutionary forces and the
changes in the enemy's circumstances. The latter stage of the Third Revolutionary
Civil war witnessed a further development, when operations were conducted
by huge formations, which, equipped with heavy arms, were able to storm strongly
fortified enemy positions.
