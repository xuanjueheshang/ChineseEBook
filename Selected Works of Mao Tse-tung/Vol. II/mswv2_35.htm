  <B>FREELY EXPAND THE ANTI-JAPANESE FORCES AND RESIST THE ONSLAUGHTS OF THE
  ANTI-COMMUNIST DIE-HARDS</B>
</H1>
<p class="title">
<EM>May 4, 1940</EM>
<p class="information">
[<I>This directive was written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung on behalf of the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and addressed to its Southeast Bureau.
At the time of writing, Comrade Hsiang Ying, member of the Central Committee
and secretary of its Southeast Bureau, held strong Rightist views and was
irresolute in carrying out the line of the Central Committee. He did not
dare fully to arouse the masses to action and to expand the Liberated Areas
and the people's army in the Japanese-occupied areas, did not sufficiently
realize the seriousness of the possibility of reactionary attacks by the
Kuomintang, and was therefore unprepared for them mentally and organizationally.
When the directive reached the Southeast Bureau, Comrade Chen Yi, member
of the Southeast Bureau and commander of the First Detachment of the New
Fourth Army, immediately put it into effect, but Comrade Hsiang Ying was
reluctant to do so. He made no preparations against the attacks of the Kuomintang
reactionaries so that he was in a weak and helpless position when Chiang
Kai-shek staged the Southern Anhwei Incident in January 1941, in which nine
thousand of our troops were annihilated and Comrade Hsiang Ying himself was
killed.</I>]

<P>
1. In all regions behind the enemy lines and in all the war zones, stress
should be laid not on particularity, but on identity; to do otherwise would
be a gross error. While each region has its individual peculiarities, they
are all identical in that all are confronted by the enemy and all are engaged
in the War of Resistance, whether in northern, central or southern China,
in the areas north or south of the Yangtse River, or in the plains, the mountain
or lake regions, and whether the force involved is the Eighth Route Army,
the New Fourth Army or the South China Guerrilla
Column.<B>[<A HREF="#bm1">1</A>]</B> It follows that in all cases we can
and should expand. The Central Committee has pointed out this policy of expansion
to you time and again. To expand means to reach out into all enemy-occupied
areas and not to be bound by the Kuomintang's restrictions but to go beyond
the limits allowed by the Kuomintang, not to expect official appointments
from them or depend on the higher-ups for financial support but instead to
expand the armed forces freely and independently, set up base areas
unhesitatingly, independently arouse the masses in those areas to action
and build up united front organs of political power under the leadership
of the Communist Party. In Kiangsu Province, for example, despite the verbal
attacks and the restrictions and oppression by anti-Communist elements such
as Ku Chu-tung, Leng Hsin and Han Teh-chin,<B>[<A HREF="#bm2">2</A>]</B>
we should gain control of as many districts as possible from Nanking in the
west to the seacoast in the east and from Hangchow in the south to Hsuchow
in the north, and do so as fast as possible and yet steadily and systematically;
and we should independently expand the armed forces, establish organs of
political power, set up fiscal offices to levy taxes for resistance to Japan
and economic agencies to promote agriculture, industry and commerce, and
open up schools of various kinds to train large numbers of cadres. The Central
Committee previously instructed you to enlarge the anti-Japanese armed forces
to 1,000,000 men, with as many rifles, and to set up organs of political
power promptly in the regions behind the enemy lines in Kiangsu and Chekiang
Provinces before the end of this year. What concrete measures have you taken?
Opportunities have been missed before, and if this year they are missed again,
things will become still more difficult.
<P>
2. At a time when the anti-Communist die-hards in the Kuomintang are obstinately
persisting in their policy of containing, restricting and combating the Communist
Party in preparation for capitulation to Japan, we must stress struggle and
not unity; to do otherwise would be a gross error. Therefore, whether in
the theoretical, the political, or the military sphere, we should as a matter
of principle firmly resist all the verbal attacks, propaganda, orders and
laws of the anti-Communist die-hards designed to contain, restrict and oppose
the Communist Party, and our attitude towards them should be one of firm
struggle. This struggle must be based on the principle of fighting on just
grounds, to our advantage, and with restraint, that is, on the principles
of self-defence, victory and truce, which means that every concrete struggle
is defensive, limited and temporary in nature. We must take tit-for-tat action
and conduct a determined struggle against all the reactionary verbal attacks,
propaganda, orders and laws of the anti-Communist die-hards. For instance,
when they demanded that our Fourth and Fifth Detachments<B>
[<A HREF="#bm3">3</A>]</B> be moved to the south, we countered by insisting
that it was absolutely impossible to do so; when they demanded that the units
under Yeh Fei and Chang Yun-yi<B> [<A HREF="#bm4">4</A>]</B> be moved to
the south, we countered by asking permission for a part of these units to
move to the north; when they charged us with having undermined their conscription
plans, we asked them to enlarge the recruiting area for the New Fourth Army;
when they said we were carrying on wrong propaganda, we asked them to stop
all their anti-Communist propaganda and to rescind all decrees and orders
which cause "friction", and whenever they launch military attacks against
us, we should smash them by counter-attacks. We are on just grounds in carrying
out this tit-for-tat policy. And it is not only the Central Committee of
our Party that should take action whenever we are on just grounds, but every
unit of our army should do so. What Chang Yun-yi did to Li Pin-hsien and
what Li Hsien-nien did to Li Tsung-jen<B> [<A HREF="#bm5">5</A>]</B> are
both good examples of strong protests from the lower levels to the higher-ups.
This kind of strong attitude towards the die-hards and the policy of struggling
against them on just grounds, to our advantage, and with restraint are the
only way to make the die-hards somewhat afraid of repressing us, to reduce
the scope of their activities in containing, restricting and combating the
Communist Party, to force them to recognize our legal status, and to make
them think twice before causing a split. Therefore, struggle is by far the
most important means of averting the danger of capitulation, of achieving
a turn for the better in the situation and of strengthening Kuomintang-Communist
co-operation. Within our own Party and army, persistence in the struggle
against the die-hards is the only way to heighten our fighting spirit, give
full play to our courage, unite our cadres, increase our strength and consolidate
our army and Party. In our relations with the intermediate sections, persistence
in the struggle against the die-hards is the only way to win over the waverers
and give support to our sympathizers-- there is no other way. Similarly,
struggle is the only policy which can ensure that the whole Party and the
whole army are mentally on the alert against a possible nation-wide emergency
and are prepared for it in their work. Otherwise, the mistake of 1927<B>
[<A HREF="#bm6">6</A>]</B> will be repeated.
<P>
3. In appraising the present situation, we should clearly understand that
while the danger of capitulation has greatly increased, it is still possible
to avert it. The present military clashes are still local and not national.
They are acts of strategic reconnaissance by our opponents and not yet "Communist
suppression" on a large scale; they are steps preparatory to capitulation
and not yet steps immediately preceding capitulation. Our task is persistently
and vigorously to carry out the threefold policy laid down by the Central
Committee, which is the only correct policy, namely, to develop the progressive
forces, win over the middle forces and isolate the die-hard forces, for the
purpose of averting the danger of capitulation and bringing about a turn
for the better in the situation. It would be perilous not to point out and
correct any "Left" or Right deviations in appraising the situation and in
defining our tasks.
<P>
4. The battles of self-defence fought by the Fourth and the Fifth Detachments
against the attacks of Han Teh-chin and Li Tsung-jen in eastern Anhwei and
those fought by Li Hsien-nien's column against the die-hards' attacks in
central and eastern Hupeh, the determined struggle carried on by Peng
Hsuch-feng's detachment north of the Huai River, the expansion of Yeh Fei's
forces north of the Yangtse River, and the southward movement of over 20,000
men of the Eighth Route Army to areas north of the Huai River and to eastern
Anhwei and northern Kiangsu<B> [<A HREF="#bm7">7</A>]</B>--all these were
not only absolutely necessary and correct in themselves, but were indispensable
for making Ku Chu-tung think twice before attacking you in southern Anhwei
and southern Kiangsu. That is to say, the more victories we win and the more
we expand north of the Yangtse River, the more will Ku Chu-tung be afraid
to act rashly south of the Yangtse River, and the easier will it be for you
to play your role in southern Anhwei and southern Kiangsu. Similarly, the
more the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army and the South China Guerrilla
Column expand in northwestern, northern, central and southern China, and
the more the Communist Party grows throughout the country, the greater will
be the possibility of averting the danger of capitulation and bringing about
a turn for the better in the situation, and the easier will it be for our
Party to play its role in all parts of the country. It is wrong to make the
opposite appraisal or adopt the opposite tactics in the belief that the more
our forces expand, the more the die-hards will tend towards capitulation,
that the more concessions we make, the more they will resist Japan, or that
the whole country is on the verge of a split and Kuomintang-Communist
co-operation is no longer possible.
<P>
5. The Anti-Japanese National United Front is our policy for the whole country
in the War of Resistance. The establishment of democratic anti-Japanese base
areas in the enemy rear is part of this policy. You should firmly carry out
the Central Committee's decisions on the question of political power.
<P>
6. Our policy in the Kuomintang areas is different from that in the war zones
and the areas behind the enemy lines. In the Kuomintang areas our policy
is to have well-selected cadres working underground for a long period, to
accumulate strength and bide our time, and to avoid rashness and exposure.
In conformity with the principle of waging struggles on just grounds, to
our advantage, and with restraint, our tactics in combating the die-hards
are to wage steady and sure struggles and to build up our strength by utilizing
all Kuomintang laws and decrees that can serve our purpose as well as everything
permitted by social custom. If a member of our Party is forced to join the
Kuomintang, let him do so; our members should penetrate the <EM>pao chia
</EM><B>[<A HREF="#bm8">8</A>]</B><EM> </EM>and the educational, economic
and military organizations everywhere; they should develop extensive united
front work, <EM>i.e.</EM>, make friends, in the Central Army and among the
troops of miscellaneous brands.<B>[<A HREF="#bm9">9</A>]</B> In all the
Kuomintang areas the Party's basic policy is likewise to develop the progressive
forces (the Party organizations and the mass movements), to win over the
middle forces (seven categories in all, namely, the national bourgeoisie,
the enlightened gentry, the troops of miscellaneous brands, the intermediate
sections in the Kuomintang, the intermediate sections in the Central Army,
the upper stratum of the petty bourgeoisie, and the small political parties
and groups) and to isolate the die-hard forces, in order to avert the danger
of capitulation and bring about a favourable turn in the situation. At the
same time we should be fully prepared to deal with any emergency on a local
or national scale. Our Party organizations in the Kuomintang areas must be
kept strictly secret. In the Southeast Bureau<B>
[<A HREF="#bm10">10</A>]</B> and in all the provincial, special, county and
district committees, the whole personnel (from Party secretaries to cooks)
must be strictly scrutinized one by one, and no one open to the slightest
suspicion should be allowed to remain in any of these leading bodies. Great
care must be taken to protect our cadres, and whoever is in danger of being
arrested and killed by the Kuomintang while working in an open or semi-open
capacity should either be sent to some other locality and go underground
or be transferred to the army. In the Japanese-occupied areas (in Shanghai,
Nanking, Wuhu or Wusih, or in any other city, large or small, and also in
the countryside), our policy is basically the same as in the Kuomintang areas.
<P>
7. The present tactical directive was decided upon by the Political Bureau
of the Central Committee at its recent meeting, and comrades of the Southeast
Bureau and the military sub-commission are requested to discuss it, relay
it to all cadres in the Party organizations and the army, and firmly carry
it out.
<P>
8. Comrade Hsiang Ying is instructed to relay this directive in southern
Anhwei and Comrade Chen Yi to relay it in southern Kiangsu. Discussion and
relaying should be completed within a month of receiving this telegram. Comrade
Hsiang Ying has the over-all responsibility for arranging Party and army
work in the whole area in accordance with the line of the Central Committee
and should report the results to the Central Committee.
