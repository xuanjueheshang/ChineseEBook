1. The present political situation is as follows:<B></B>
<P CLASS="INDENTB">
  (a) Japanese imperialism has been dealt a heavy blow by China's War of Resistance
  and is already incapable of launching any more large-scale military offensives,
  so that the relation of forces between the enemy and ourselves has now reached
  the stage of strategic stalemate. But the enemy is still holding fast to
  his basic policy of subjugating China and is pursuing it by such means as
  undermining our anti-Japanese united front, intensifying his "mopping-up"
  campaigns in the rear areas and stepping up his economic aggression.
<P CLASS="INDENTB">
  (b) Britain and France are finding their positions in the East weakened by
  the war in Europe, while the United States is continuing its policy of "sitting
  on top of the mountain and watching the tigers fight", so that an Eastern
  Munich <B>[<A HREF="#bm1">1</A>]</B> conference is out of the question for
  the moment.
<P CLASS="INDENTB">
  (c) The Soviet Union has gained new successes in its foreign policy and is
  maintaining its policy of giving active support to China's War of Resistance.
<P CLASS="INDENTB">
  (d) The pro-Japanese section of the big bourgeoisie, having completely
  capitulated to Japan, is ready to play the puppet. The pro-European and
  pro-American big bourgeoisie may continue to resist Japan, but its proneness
  to conciliation remains serious. It follows a dual policy. While desiring
  to remain united with the various non-Kuomintang forces to cope with Japan,
  it is doing all it can to suppress them, and especially the Communist Party
  and the other progressive forces. It forms the die-hard section of the
  anti-Japanese united front.
<P CLASS="INDENTB">
  (e) The intermediate forces, including the middle bourgeoisie, the enlightened
  gentry and the regional power groups, often take a middle position between
  the progressives and the die-hards because of their contradictions with the
  main ruling sections of the big landlords and the big bourgeoisie on the
  one hand, and with the working class and the peasantry on the other. They
  form the middle section of the anti-Japanese united front.
<P CLASS="INDENTB">
  (f) Recently, the Communist-led progressive forces of the proletariat, the
  peasantry and the urban petty bourgeoisie have grown much stronger and in
  the main have succeeded in creating base areas in which anti-Japanese democratic
  political power has been established. Their influence is very great among
  the workers, peasants and urban petty bourgeoisie throughout the country
  and is also quite considerable among the middle forces. On the battlefield
  the Communists are fighting roughly as many Japanese troops as is the Kuomintang.
  They form the progressive section of the anti-Japanese united front.
</p>
<P>
This is the present political situation in China. In these circumstances
the possibility still exists of preventing the situation from deteriorating
and of changing it for the better; the Central Committee's resolutions of
February 1 are entirely correct.
<P>
2. The basic condition for victory in the War of Resistance is the extension
and consolidation of the anti-Japanese united front. The tactics required
for this purpose are to develop the progressive forces, win over the middle
forces and combat the die-hard forces; these are three inseparable links,
and the means to be used to unite all the anti-Japanese forces is struggle.
In the period of the anti-Japanese united front, struggle is the means to
unity and unity is the aim of struggle. If unity is sought through struggle,
it will live; if unity is sought through yielding, it will perish. This truth
is gradually being grasped by Party comrades. However, there are still many
who do not understand it; some think that struggle will split the united
front or that struggle can be employed without restraint, and others use
wrong tactics towards the middle forces or have mistaken notions about the
die-hard forces. All this must be corrected.
<P>
3. Developing the progressive forces means building up the forces of the
proletariat, the peasantry and the urban petty bourgeoisie, boldly expanding
the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies, establishing anti-Japanese democratic
base areas on an extensive scale, building up Communist organizations throughout
the country, developing national mass movements of the workers, peasants,
youth, women and children, winning over the intellectuals in all parts of
the country, and spreading the movement for constitutional government among
the masses as a struggle for democracy. Steady expansion of the progressive
forces is the only way to prevent the situation from deteriorating, to forestall
capitulation and splitting, and to lay a firm and indestructible foundation
for victory in the War of Resistance. But the expansion of the progressive
forces is a serious process of struggle, which must be ruthlessly waged not
only against the Japanese imperialists and the traitors but also against
the die-hards. For the latter are opposed to the growth of the progressive
forces, while the middle section is sceptical. Unless we engage in resolute
struggle against the die-hards and, moreover, get tangible results, we shall
be unable to resist their pressure or dispel the doubts of the middle section.
In that case the progressive forces will have no way of expanding.
<P>
4. Winning over the middle forces means winning over the middle bourgeoisie,
the enlightened gentry and the regional power groups. They are three distinct
categories, but as things are, they all belong to the middle forces. The
middle bourgeoisie constitutes the national bourgeoisie as distinct from
the comprador class, <EM>i.e.</EM>, from the big bourgeoisie. Although it
has its class contradictions with the workers and does not approve of the
independence of the working class, it still wants to resist Japan and, moreover,
would like to grasp political power for itself, because it is oppressed by
the Japanese imperialists in the occupied areas and kept down by the big
landlords and big bourgeoisie in the Kuomintang areas. When it comes to resisting
Japan, it is in favour of united resistance; when it comes to winning political
power, it is in favour of the movement for constitutional government and
tries to exploit the contradictions between the progressives and the die-hards
for its own ends. This is a stratum we must win over. Then there are the
enlightened gentry who are the left-wing of the landlord class, that is,
the section with a bourgeois colouration, whose political attitude is roughly
the same as that of the middle bourgeoisie. Although they have class
contradictions with the peasants, they also have their contradictions with
the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. They do not support the die-hards
and they, too, want to exploit the contradictions between us and the die-hards
for their own political ends. On no account should we neglect this section
either, and our policy must be to win them over. As for the regional power
groups, they are of two kinds--the forces which control certain regions as
their own, and the troops of miscellaneous brands which do not. Although
these groups are in contradiction with the progressive forces, they also
have their contradictions with the Kuomintang Central Government because
of the self-seeking policy it pursues at their expense; they, too, want to
exploit the contradictions between us and the die-hards for their own political
ends. Most of the leaders of the regional power groups belong to the big
landlord class and the big bourgeoisie and, therefore, progressive as they
may appear at certain times during the war, they soon turn reactionary again;
nevertheless, because of their contradictions with the Kuomintang central
authorities, the possibility exists of their remaining neutral in our struggle
against the die-hards, provided we pursue a correct policy. Our policy towards
the three categories of middle forces described above is to win them over.
However, this policy differs from that of winning over the peasants and the
urban petty bourgeoisie, and, moreover, it varies for each category of the
middle forces. While the peasants and the urban petty bourgeoisie should
be won over as basic allies, the middle forces should be won over as allies
against imperialism. Among the middle forces, it is possible for the middle
bourgeoisie and the enlightened gentry to join us in the common fight against
Japan and also in the setting up of anti-Japanese democratic political power,
but they fear agrarian revolution. In the struggle against the die-hards,
some may join in to a limited degree, others may observe a benevolent neutrality,
and still others a rather reluctant neutrality. But, apart from joining us
in the war, the regional power groups will at most observe a temporary neutrality
in our struggle against the die-hards; they are unwilling to join us in
establishing democratic political power since they themselves belong to the
big landlord class and the big bourgeoisie. The middle forces tend to vacillate
and are bound to break up, and we should educate and criticize them
appropriately, with special reference to their vacillating attitude.
<P>
The winning over of the middle forces is an extremely important task for
us in the period of the anti-Japanese united front, but it can only be
accomplished given certain conditions. These are: (1) that we have ample
strength; (2) that we respect their interests; and (3) that we are resolute
in our struggle against the die-hards and steadily win victories. If these
conditions are lacking, the middle forces will vacillate or even become allies
of the die-hards in the latter's attacks on us, because the die-hards are
also doing their best to win over the middle forces in order to isolate us.
The middle forces carry considerable weight in China and may often be the
decisive factor in our struggle against the die-hards; we must therefore
be prudent in dealing with them.
<P>
5. The die-hard forces at the present time are the big landlord class and
the big bourgeoisie. Divided at the moment into the group that has capitulated
to Japan and the group that favours resistance, these classes will gradually
become still further differentiated. Within the big bourgeoisie, the group
favouring resistance is now different from the group that has already
capitulated. It pursues a dual policy. It still stands for unity against
Japan, but at the same time it follows the extremely reactionary policy of
suppressing the progressive forces in preparation for its eventual capitulation.
As it still favours unity against Japan, we can still try and keep it in
the anti-Japanese united front, and the longer the better. It would be wrong
to neglect our policy of winning over this group and co-operating with it
and to regard it as having already capitulated and as being on the verge
of launching an anti-Communist war. But at the same time, we must adopt tactics
of struggle to combat its reactionary policy and carry on a determined
ideological, political and military fight against it, because all over the
country it pursues the reactionary policy of suppressing the progressive
forces, because instead of carrying out the common programme of the revolutionary
Three People's Principles it stubbornly opposes our efforts to do so, and
because it works hard to prevent us from going beyond the limits it has set
for us, <EM>i.e.</EM>; it tries to confine us to the passive resistance it
itself practices, and, moreover, it tries to assimilate us, failing which
it applies ideological, political and military pressure against us. Such
is our revolutionary dual policy to meet the dual policy of the die-hards,
and such is our policy of seeking unity through struggle. If in the ideological
sphere we can put forward correct revolutionary theory and strike hard at
their counterrevolutionary theory, if in the political sphere we adopt tactics
suited to the times and strike hard at their anti-Communist and anti-progressive
policies, and if in the military sphere we take appropriate measures and
strike back hard at their attacks, then we shall be able to restrict the
effective range of their reactionary policy and compel them to recognize
the status of the progressive forces, and we shall be able to expand the
progressive forces, win over the middle forces and isolate the die-hard forces.
What is more, we shall be able to induce those die-hards who are still willing
to resist Japan to prolong their participation in the anti-Japanese united
front, and shall thus be able to avert a large-scale civil war of the kind
that broke out before. Thus the purpose of our struggle against the die-hards
in the period of the anti-Japanese united front is not only to parry their
attacks in order to protect the progressive forces and enable the latter
to go on growing, it is also to<B> </B>prolong the die-hards' resistance
to Japan and to preserve our co-operation with them in order to avert large-scale
civil war. Without struggle, these progressive forces would be exterminated
by the die-hard forces, the united front would cease to exist, there would
be nothing to hinder the die-hards from capitulating to the enemy, and civil
war would break out. Therefore, struggle against the die-hards is an
indispensable means of uniting all the anti-Japanese forces, achieving a
favourable turn in the situation and averting large-scale civil war. All
our experience confirms this truth.
<P>
However, there are several principles which we must observe in our struggle
against the die-hards in the period of the anti-Japanese united front. First,
the principle of self-defence. We will not attack unless we are attacked;
if we are attacked, we will certainly counter-attack. That is to say, we
must never attack others without provocation, but once attacked we must never
fail to return the blow. Herein lies the defensive nature of our struggle.
The military attacks of the die-hards must be smashed--resolutely, thoroughly,
wholly and completely. Second, the principle of victory. We will not fight
unless we are sure of victory; we must never fight without a plan, without
preparation, and without certainty of success. We must know how to exploit
the contradictions among the die-hards and must not take on too many of them
at a single time, but must direct our blows at the most reactionary of them
first. Herein lies the limited nature of the struggle. Third, the principle
of a truce. After repulsing one die-hard attack, we should know when to stop
and bring that particular fight to a close before another attack is made
on us. A truce should be made in the interval. We should then take the initiative
in seeking unity with the die-hards and, if they concur, we should make a
peace agreement with them. On no account should we fight on day after day
without cease, or be carried away by success. Herein lies the temporary nature
of each struggle. Only when the die-hards launch a new attack should we counter
with a new struggle. In other words, the three principles are to fight "on
just grounds", "to our advantage" and "with restraint". By keeping to this
kind of struggle, waged on just grounds, to our advantage and with restraint,
we can develop the progressive forces, win over the middle forces and isolate
the die-hard forces, and we can also make the die-hards think twice before
attacking us, compromising with the enemy or starting large-scale civil war.
Thus a favourable turn in the<B> </B>situation will become possible.
<P>
6. The Kuomintang is a heterogeneous party which includes die-hards, middle
elements and progressives; taken as a whole, it must not be equated with
the die-hards. Some people regard the Kuomintang as consisting entirely of
die-hards because its Central Executive Committee has promulgated such
counter-revolutionary friction-mongering decrees as the "Measures for Restricting
the Activities of Alien Parties" and has mobilized every ounce of its strength
for counter-revolutionary friction-mongering in the ideological, political,
and military spheres throughout the country. But this is a mistaken view.
The die-hards in the Kuomintang are still in a position to dictate its policies,
but numerically they are in a minority, while the majority of the membership
(many are members only in name) are not necessarily die-hards. This point
must be clearly recognized if we are to take advantage of the contradictions
within the Kuomintang, follow a policy of differentiating between its different
sections and do our utmost to unite with its middle and progressive sections.
<P>
7. On the question of political power in the anti-Japanese base areas, we
must make sure that the political power established there is that of the
Anti-Japanese National United Front. No such political power exists as yet
in the Kuomintang areas. It is the political power of all who support both
resistance and democracy, <EM>i.e.</EM>, the joint democratic dictatorship
of several revolutionary classes over the traitors and reactionaries. It
is different from the dictatorship of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie,
and is also somewhat different from a strictly worker-peasant democratic
dictatorship. Places in the organs of political power should be allocated
as follows: one-third to the Communists, representing the proletariat and
the poor peasantry; one-third to the left progressives, representing the
petty bourgeoisie; and the remaining one-third to the middle and other elements,
representing the middle bourgeoisie and the enlightened gentry. Traitors
and anti-Communist elements are the only people disqualified from participation
in these organs of political power. This general rule for the allocation
of places is necessary, or otherwise it will not be possible to maintain
the principle of united front political power. This allocation of places
represents the genuine policy of our Party and must be carried out
conscientiously; there must be no half-heartedness about it. It provides
a broad rule which has to be applied according to the specific conditions,
and there must be no mechanical filling up of quotas. At the lowest level
the ratio may have to be somewhat modified to prevent domination by the landlords
and evil gentry, but the fundamental spirit of this policy must not be violated.
We should not labour the question of whether the non-Communists in these
organs have party affiliations, or what their party affiliations are. In
areas under the political power of the united front, all political parties,
whether the Kuomintang or any other, must be granted legal status so long
as they co-operate with and do not oppose the Communist Party. On the question
of suffrage, the policy is that every Chinese who reaches the age of eighteen
and is in favour of resistance and democracy should have the right to elect
and to be elected, irrespective of class, nationality, party affiliation,
sex, creed or educational level. The organs of united front political power
should be elected by the people and then apply to the National Government
for confirmation. Their form of organization must be based on democratic
centralism. The fundamental point of departure for all major policy measures
in the united front organs of political power should be opposition to Japanese
imperialism, opposition to confirmed traitors and reactionaries, protection
of the people who are resisting Japan, proper adjustment of the interests
of all the anti-Japanese social strata and improvement of the livelihood
of the workers and peasants. The establishment of this anti-Japanese united
front political power will exert a great influence on the whole country and
serve as a model for united front political power on a national scale; therefore
this policy should be fully understood and resolutely carried out by all
Party comrades.
<P>
8. In our struggle to develop the progressive forces, win over the middle
forces and isolate the die-hard forces, we must not overlook the role of
the intellectuals, whom the die-hards are doing their utmost to win over;
therefore it is an important and indeed an essential policy to win over all
progressive intellectuals and bring them under the influence of the Party.
<P>
9. In our propaganda we should stress the following programme:
<P CLASS="INDENTB">
  (a) carry out the Testament of Dr. Sun Yat-sen by arousing the masses for
  united resistance to Japan;
<P CLASS="INDENTB">
  (b) carry out the Principle of Nationalism by firmly resisting Japanese
  imperialism and striving for complete national liberation and the equality
  of all the nationalities within China;
<P CLASS="INDENTB">
  (c) carry out the Principle of Democracy by granting the people absolute
  freedom to resist Japan and save the nation, by enabling them to elect
  governments at all levels, and by establishing the revolutionary democratic
  political power of the Anti-Japanese National United Front;
<P CLASS="INDENTB">
  (d) carry out the Principle of the People's Livelihood by abolishing exorbitant
  taxes and miscellaneous levies, reducing land<B> </B>rent and interest, enforcing
  the eight-hour working day, developing agriculture, industry and commerce,
  and improving the<B> </B>livelihood of the people; and
<P CLASS="INDENTB">
  (e) carry out Chiang Kai-shek's declaration that "every person, young or
  old, in the north or in the south, must take up the responsibility of resisting
  Japan and defending our homeland".
</p>
<P>
All these points are in the Kuomintang's own published programme, which is
also the common programme of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. But
the Kuomintang has failed to carry out any part of this programme other than
resistance to Japan; only the Communist Party and the progressive forces
are able to carry it out. It is a simple enough programme and is widely known,
yet many Communists fail to use it as a weapon for mobilizing the masses
and isolating the die-hards. From now on we should keep attention focussed
on the five points of this programme and popularize them through public notices,
manifestoes, leaflets, articles, speeches, statements, and so on. In the
Kuomintang areas it is still only a propaganda programme, but in the areas
reached by the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army it is already a
programme of<EM> </EM>action. In acting according to this programme we are
within the law, and when the die-hards oppose<EM> </EM>our carrying it out,
it is they who are outside the law. In the stage of the bourgeois-democratic
revolution, this programme of<EM> </EM>the Kuomintang's is basically the
same as ours, but the ideology of<EM> </EM>the Kuomintang is entirely different
from that of the Communist Party. It is this common programme of the democratic
revolution that we should put into practice, but on no account should we
follow the ideology of the Kuomintang.
