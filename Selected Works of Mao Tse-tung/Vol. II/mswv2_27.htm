<p class="title">
<EM>January 28, 1940</EM>
<p class="information">
[<I>This was an inner-Party directive written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung on
behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.</I>]
  <hr class="end" />
<P>
Current developments confirm the correctness of the Central Committee's
appraisals. The line of capitulation taken by the big landlord class and
the big bourgeoisie runs sharply counter to the line of armed resistance
taken by the proletariat, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie and
the middle bourgeoisie, and there is a struggle between the two. Both lines
exist at present, and one or the other can win out in the future. What all
our Party comrades must realize in this connection is that the serious cases
of capitulation, anti-communism and retrogression which have occurred in
various places should not be viewed in isolation. We should realize their
seriousness, combat them resolutely and not be overwhelmed by their impact.
If we lack this spirit and a correct policy for dealing firmly with these
incidents, if we let the Kuomintang die-hards continue their "military and
political restriction of the Communist Party" and are in constant dread at
the thought of the break-up of the united front, then the War of Resistance
will be jeopardized, capitulation and anti-communism will spread throughout
the country, and there will be a real danger of the break-up of the united
front. But it must be made abundantly clear that many objective conditions
favourable to our struggle for continued resistance, unity and progress are
still present both at home and abroad. For example, Japan's policy towards
China remains as tough as ever; it is very difficult to rig up a Far Eastern
Munich conference because there has been no real reconciliation between Japan
on the one hand and Britain, the United States and France on the other despite
some lessening of the contradictions between them, and because the British
and French positions in the East have been weakened by the European war;
and the Soviet Union is actively helping China. These are the international
factors which render it difficult for the Kuomintang to capitulate or compromise,
or to launch a nation-wide anti-Communist war. At home, the Communist Party
and the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies are firmly opposing capitulation
and upholding the policy of resistance and unity; the intermediate classes,
too, are against capitulation; and the capitulators and the die-hards within
the Kuomintang, though in power, are numerically a minority. These are the
domestic factors which render it difficult for the Kuomintang to capitulate
or compromise, or to launch a nation-wide anti-Communist war. In these
circumstances, our Party has a twofold task. On the one hand, it must resolutely
resist the military and political offensives of the capitulators and die-hards.
On the other, it must actively develop the united front of the political
parties, the government organs, the armed forces, the civilian population
and the intellectuals; it must do its utmost to win over the majority of
the Kuomintang, the intermediate classes and sympathizers in the armies fighting
Japan, to deepen the mass movement, to win over the intellectuals, to consolidate
the anti-Japanese base areas, expand the anti-Japanese armed forces and the
organs of anti-Japanese political power, and consolidate our Party and ensure
its progress. If we do both these tasks simultaneously, we shall be able
to overcome the danger of capitulation by the big landlords and the big
bourgeoisie and to bring about a turn for the better in the whole situation.
Therefore, the present general policy of the Party is to strive for a turn
for the better and at the same time to be on guard against any emergencies
(such emergencies, so far, being on a limited and local scale).
<P>
Now that Wang Ching-wei has announced his traitorous pact<B>
[<A HREF="#bm1">1</A>]</B> and Chiang Kai-shek has published his message
to the nation, it is beyond doubt that the agitation for peace will suffer
a setback and that the forces favouring resistance will grow; on the other
hand, the "military and political restriction of the Communist Party" will
continue, there will be more local incidents, and the Kuomintang may stress
so-called "unification against the foreign enemy" in order to attack us.
The reason is that the forces supporting resistance and progress cannot build
up enough strength in the immediate future to overwhelm the forces supporting
capitulation and retrogression. Our policy is to spare no effort in extending
the propaganda campaign against Wang Ching-wei's traitorous pact in all parts
of the country having Communist Party organizations. In his message, Chiang
Kai-shek states that he will carry on the War of Resistance, but he does
not stress the need to strengthen national unity, nor does he mention any
policy for persevering in resistance and progress, without which it would
be impossible to persist in the war. Hence in the campaign against Wang Ching-wei
we should stress the following points: (1) support the national policy of
waging the War of Resistance to the very end and oppose Wang Ching-wei's
traitorous pact; (2) the whole country must unite and overthrow the traitor
Wang Ching-wei and his puppet central government; (3) support
Kuomintang-Communist co-operation and crush Wang Ching-wei's anti-Communist
policy; (4) down with the hidden traitors of the Wang Ching-wei brand,
anti-communism being Wang Ching-wei's plot for splitting the anti-Japanese
united front; (5) strengthen national unity and eliminate internal "friction";
(6) introduce political reforms, unfold the movement for constitutionalism
and institute democracy; (7) lift the ban on political parties and grant
legal status to anti-Japanese parties and groups; (8) guarantee the people
freedom of speech and assembly in order to combat the Japanese and the traitors;
(9) consolidate the anti-Japanese base areas and oppose the disruptive plots
of the Wang Ching-wei brand of traitors; (10) support the troops who are
fighting really well in the war and give adequate supplies to the fronts;
and (11) promote cultural activities which help the cause of resistance,
protect the progressive youth and proscribe all expression of collaborationist
views. The above slogans should be widely publicized. Large numbers of articles,
manifestoes, leaflets and pamphlets should be published and speeches delivered,
and other slogans suitable to local circumstances should be added.
<P>
A mass rally to denounce Wang Ching-wei's traitorous pact is scheduled to
be held on February 1 in Yenan. Together with the people of all circles and
with the anti-Japanese members of the Kuomintang, we should organize similar
mass rallies in all areas in the early part or the middle of February in
order to create a nation-wide upsurge against capitulation, against the
collaborators and against "friction".
