[Message of greetings delivered on behalf of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party to the National Conferences of Combat Heroes and
of Model Workers in Industry, Agriculture and the Army. ] 
  <hr class="end" />
<P>
Comrade Delegates to the National Conferences of Combat Heroes and of Model
Workers in Industry, Agriculture and the Army:
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sends your conferences
warm greetings and wishes to thank and salute you for the work you have done.
<P>
You have overcome a host of difficulties and hardships and demonstrated immense
courage, wisdom and enthusiasm in the struggle to wipe out the enemy and
in the struggle to restore and increase industrial and agricultural production.
You are models for the whole Chinese nation, activists propelling the people's
cause forward to triumph in all spheres of endeavour, a firm pillar of support
to the People's Government and a bridge linking the People's Government with
the masses.
<P>
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party calls on the whole Party
and nation to learn from you and at the same time calls on you, dear comrade
delegates, and on all the combat heroes and model workers of the country,
to keep on learning through struggle and from the masses. Only by guarding
against conceit and complacency and continuing to learn tirelessly can you
go on making outstanding contributions to the great People's Republic of
China and thus live up to your names.
<P>
China must build a powerful national defence force and a powerful economy
-- two tasks of major importance. Fulfilment of these tasks depends on you
comrades forging close ties of unity and making concerted efforts together
with all the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and
all the workers, peasants and other sections of the people. As the first
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is approaching,
your meeting here is of signal importance. We wish you success in your
conferences and great victories in your work in the days to come.
