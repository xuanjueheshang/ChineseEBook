Comrades in Yenan and Fellow-Countrymen in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border
Region:
<P>
I am very happy and grateful to receive your message of greetings. From 1936
to 1948 Yenan and the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region were the seat of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the general rear
area of the Chinese people's struggle for liberation. The people of Yenan
and the Border Region have made great contributions to the whole nation.
I wish you continued unity, speedy recovery from the wounds of war and progress
in your economic and cultural construction. And I hope that the revolutionary
personnel of the whole country will always keep to the style of plain living
and hard struggle maintained for more than a decade by the working personnel
in Yenan and the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region.
