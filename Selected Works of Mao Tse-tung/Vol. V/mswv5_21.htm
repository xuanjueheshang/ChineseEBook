[Written comment on a document drafted by the United Front Work Department
of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Comrade Mao Tsetung
criticized the head of this department for his error in regarding the national
bourgeoisie as an intermediate class.]

<P>
With the overthrow of the landlord class and the bureaucrat-capitalist class,
the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie
has become the principal contradiction in China; therefore the national
bourgeoisie should no longer be defined as an intermediate class.
