  THE PARTY'S GENERAL LINE FOR THE TRANSITION PERIOD
</h1><p><p class="title">
<EM>August 1953</EM>
<P class="information">
[Important directive written by Comrade Mao Tsetung when he went over the
summing-up to be made by Comrade Chou En-lai at the National Conference on
Financial and Economic Work held in the summer of 1953.] 
  <hr class="end" />
<P>
The time between the founding of the People's Republic of China and the basic
completion of socialist transformation is a period of transition. The Party's
general line or general task for the transition period is basically to accomplish
the country's industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture,
handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce over a fairly long period
of time. This general line should be the beacon illuminating all our work,
and wherever we deviate from it, we shall make Right or "Left" mistakes.
<P>
Many policies under this general line were already set forth and decided
upon in principle in the resolution adopted at the Second Plenary Session
of the Seventh Central Committee held in March 1949. Nevertheless, many comrades
were not inclined to work in accordance with the decisions of the Second
Plenary Session and on some matters preferred to go their own way contrary
to the session's decisions or even openly violated its principles.
