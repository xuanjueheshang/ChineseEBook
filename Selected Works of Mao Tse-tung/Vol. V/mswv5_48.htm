  EDITOR'S NOTES FROM SOCIALIST UPSURGE IN CHINA'S COUNTRYSIDE
</h1><p><p class="title">
<EM>September and December 1955</EM>
<P class="information">
[In editing <EM>Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside, </EM>Comrade Mao
Tsetung wrote cod notes, of which 4, have been selected here. At the enlarged
meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party held in Chengtu in March 1958, part of the notes was reprinted. On
March 19, 1958 Comrade Mao Tsetung wrote an explanation, the full text of
which reads:
<P>
These notes which appeared in the book entitled <EM>Socialist Upsurge in
China's Countryside </EM>were written in September and December 1955. To
this day some have not lost their significance. There is however one statement
in the notes to the effect that 1955 was the year in which socialism won
basic victory in the decisive battle with capitalism; it is not proper to
put it that way. This is the way it should be put: 1955 was the year in which
basic victory was won as regards the aspect of ownership in the relations
of production, while in the other aspects of the relations of production
as well as in some aspects of the superstructure, namely, on the ideological
and political fronts, either a basic victory was not won or, if won, the
victory was not complete, and further efforts were required. We did not
anticipate that such a great storm would burst upon the world in 1956, nor
did we anticipate that a campaign to "oppose rash advance" would occur in
the same year in our country, a campaign which dampened the enthusiasm of
the masses. Both events gave a considerable stimulus to the Rightists in
mounting their wild attacks. Hence a lesson can be drawn: neither socialist
revolution nor socialist construction is plain sailing, and we should be
prepared to cope with the many great difficulties that may crop up at home
and abroad. Both internationally and domestically the general situation is
favourable, we can be sure of this, but many serious difficulties are bound
to occur and we must be prepared to tackle them.]

This is a very well written article which deserves to be recommended to the
reader as the first piece in this book. As described at the beginning of
the article, in many parts of the country there are still quite a few people
who are "steering clear of the co-op" because they are ignorant about it
and are afraid of being asked questions. "Resolute contraction", the wholesale
dissolution of co-operatives by command, is likewise a manifestation of "steering
clear of the co-op"; the only difference is that, instead of taking a passive
attitude of evasion, these people take a very active attitude and "axe" (to
use their own expression) a great many co-operatives with one fell blow.
Axe in hand, they chop and thus avoid troublesome problems. They say that
there are all sorts of difficulties in running co-operatives, and according
to them the difficulties defy the imagination. However, there are countless
examples throughout the country which give the lie to their arguments. One
such example is the experience of Tsunhua County, Hopei Province. In 1952<EM>
</EM>no one there knew how to run a co-operative. Their solution was to learn
how. Their slogan was: "The Party secretary pitches in and all Party members
help run the co-ops." The result was: "from knowing nothing to knowing a
lot", "from a few knowing how to many knowing how", "from district cadres
running the co-ops to the masses running them". In the three years from
1952<EM> </EM>to 1954<EM>, </EM>the eleven townships of the Tenth District,
Tsunhua County, Hopei Province, basically completed semi-socialist co-operative
transformation, with 85<EM> </EM>per cent of the 4,343<EM> </EM>peasant
households drawn into co-operatives. Compared with 1952,<EM> </EM>production
in agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry in this district showed the
following increases in 1954<B><EM>:</EM></B> grain 76<EM> </EM>per cent,
timber trees 56.4<EM> </EM>per cent, fruit trees 62.87<EM> </EM>per cent
and sheep 463<EM>.</EM>1 per cent.
<P>
Now we have every reason to raise this question: if this could be done here,
why can't it be done elsewhere? If you say it can't, what are your reasons?
I can see only one reason -- unwillingness to take the trouble, or, to put
it more bluntly, Right opportunism. Hence "steering clear of the co-op",
hence the Party secretary not pitching in and all Party members not helping
to run the co-operatives, and hence from knowing nothing to still knowing
nothing, from a few knowing how to still only a few knowing how, from district
cadres running the co-operatives to still only district cadres running them.
Or else, axe in hand, chopping down any troublesome co-operative in sight.
If that reason prevails, then nothing can be accomplished. We have put forward
such slogans as "active leadership and steady advance" and "comprehensive
planning and more effective leadership", and we agree with the perfectly
correct slogan raised by the comrades of Tsunhua County, "The Party secretary
pitches in and all Party members help run the co-ops." Hasn't there been
"active leadership and steady advance" in Tsunhua County? Hasn't there been
"comprehensive planning and more effective leadership"? Of course there has.
Is this dangerous? Is this "rash advance"? Such danger as exists lies in
"steering clear of the co-op", and this has been overcome by the Tsunhua
County comrades. The danger also lies in "axing" co-operatives wholesale
on the pretext of opposing "rash advance", but this did not happen in Tsunhua
County. If, as is alleged, "the development of the co-operatives has gone
beyond the level of political consciousness of the masses and the ability
of the cadres to lead", how can one explain what happened in Tsunhua County?
There the masses actually pressed for co-operation, there the cadres did
change from knowing nothing to knowing a lot. Everybody has eyes, does anyone
see any danger in Tsunhua County? In the three years in which they completed
co-operative transformation step by step, grain increased by 76 per cent,
timber trees by 56.4 per cent, fruit trees by 62.87 per cent and sheep by
463.1 per cent. Can this be considered any kind of danger? Can this be called
"rash advance"? Can this be regarded as "having gone beyond the level of
political consciousness of the masses and the ability of the cadres to lead"?
<P>
In the Tsunhua County co-operative movement there is the Wang Kuo-fan
Co-operative, once known as a "paupers' co-op" because its twenty-three poor
peasant households owned only "three legs" of a donkey. Relying on their
own efforts, its members "made the mountains yield"<B>
[<A HREF="#bm1">1</A>]</B> a substantial amount of the means of production
in three years, a feat which moved not a few visitors to tears. This, in
my view, is the image of our entire nation. Why can't 600 million "paupers"
create a prosperous and strong socialist country in several decades by their
own efforts? Society's wealth is created by workers, peasants and working
intellectuals. Provided they take their destiny into their own hands, provided
they have a Marxist-Leninist line and energetically tackle problems instead
of evading them, they can overcome any difficulty on earth.
<P>
Finally, we wish to thank the author of this article which carries no byline.
Brimming with enthusiasm and writing in a lively style, he gives a detailed
description of the process of the co-operative transformation of agriculture
in one district. This will be no small contribution to co-operative
transformation in the whole country. We hope every province, prefecture and
county can produce one or more such articles.

Co-ops")

For many people in China 1955 has been a year of shattered illusions. In
the first half of the year many still clung tenaciously to their own beliefs
on certain questions. But by the second half, they could no longer do so
and had to believe in the new. Examples follow: They held that "co-operative
transformation in three years" as demanded by the masses was only an idle
dream; that co-operation could be achieved more quickly in the north but
not in the south; that it was impossible to run co-operatives in backward
townships, in mountain areas, in minority nationality areas, in areas populated
by several nationalities or in areas stricken by natural calamities; that
it was easy to set up a co-operative but hard to consolidate it; that the
peasants were too poor and had no way of raising funds; that the peasants
were illiterate and bookkeepers were not available; that more co-operatives
meant more troubles; that the development of the co-operatives had gone beyond
the level of political consciousness of the masses and the experience of
the cadres; that the Party's policy of state monopoly for the purchase and
marketing of grain and its policy on co-operation were dampening the peasants'
enthusiasm for production; that unless the Communist Party backed down
immediately on the question of co-operation, it would be running the risk
of breaking up the worker-peasant alliance; that co-operative transformation
would produce a vast pool of surplus labour-power for which there would be
no outlet. And many more examples of the kind could be cited. In a word,
these were all illusions. All of them were shattered after being criticized
by the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China in October 1955. A high tide of socialist
transformation is sweeping through the rural areas, and the masses are jubilant.
This has been a profound lesson for all Communists. The masses have such
a vast reservoir of socialist enthusiasm, but why was it that many of the
leading organizations could be so insensitive or only barely sensitive to
this a few months ago? Why was there such a difference between what was on
the minds of some leaders and what was on the minds of the masses? Taking
this as a lesson, how should one handle similar cases and problems in the
future? There is only one answer. Don't divorce yourselves from the masses;
instead learn to discern the enthusiasm of the masses in its essence.

All those who believe it impossible for each individual area to achieve
lower-stage co-operative transformation in three years (co-operation in three
years was the slogan raised by the masses but criticized by the opportunists)
and all those who believe it impossible for the areas liberated later to
go co-operative at the same time as those liberated earlier, please take
a good look at this township in Kunshan County, Kiangsu Province! Here,
co-operative transformation took not three years but two. It is not an old
liberated area but a 100 per cent new liberated area. And it is running ahead
of many of the old liberated areas. What can you do about it? Pull it back?
Of course not. The opportunists just have to admit defeat. The masses have
a vast reservoir of enthusiasm for socialism. Those who know no better than
to keep to the old routine even in times of revolution are utterly incapable
of seeing this enthusiasm. They are blind and all is dark ahead of them.
At times they go so far as to confound right and wrong and turn things upside
down. Haven't we come across enough of such people? Only knowing how to keep
to the old routine, they invariably underestimate the people's enthusiasm.
Let something new appear and they always disapprove and immediately oppose
it. Later they admit defeat and do a little self<B>-</B>criticism. The next
time something new appears, they again go through the same process, one attitude
alternating with the other. And this is the way they will behave in regard
to everything new. Such people are always passive in that at the critical
moment they stand still and have to be given a hard shove in the back before
they take a step forward. Just how long will it be before such people can
manage to move of their own accord and walk properly? There is a cure for
those who have this kind of ailment: take some time out and go among the
masses, learn what they are thinking about, see what they are doing, and
find out their advanced experience and spread it. This is an effective
prescription for chronic Right opportunism, and those so afflicted are advised
to give it a try.

This is a good article. Reading it one can see that the Uighur peasants are
very eager to take the road of co-operation. They have already trained the
cadres they need for semi-socialist co-operative transformation. Some people
claim that co-operation cannot succeed among the minority nationalities.
This is not so. We have seen quite a few co-operatives run either separately
by the Mongolian, Hui, Uighur, Miao, Chuang and other minority nationalities
or jointly by people of several nationalities, and they are all very successful.
This fact refutes the erroneous views of those who look down on the minority
nationalities.

<h4>

<P>
This is an excellent article which will convince many people. The Party
organization here has never wavered on the question of co-operation. It stood
four-square behind the badly-off peasants in their demand for organizing
a co-operative, with the result that they won out in their competition with
the well-to-do middle peasants, developed a small co-operative into a big
one and increased production each year, and that the whole village went
co-operative in less than three years. The well-to-do middle peasants had
jeered, "Imagine, those paupers think they can set up a co-op. Never heard
of chicken feathers flying up to heaven." And yet the chicken feathers have
done just that. This is a struggle between the two roads -- socialism versus
capitalism. In China, the rich peasant economy is very weak (that portion
of the rich peasants' land operated in a semi-feudal way was requisitioned
during agrarian reform, most of the old rich peasants no longer hire labour,
and socially they are very much discredited), but the well-to-do and fairly
well-to-do middle peasants who constitute 20 to 30 per cent of the rural
population are quite strong. An important aspect of the struggle between
the two roads in China's countryside manifests itself in the peaceful competition
of the poor and lower-middle peasants with the well-to-do middle peasants.
Who can increase production within two or three years, the well-to-do middle
peasants working on their own, or the poor and lower-middle peasants working
together in co-operatives? In the beginning, the competition was between
a number of poor and lower-middle peasants organized in co-operatives and
the well-to-do middle peasants working on their own, with most of the poor
and lower-middle peasants looking on; it was a contest between the two sides
to win over the masses. Behind the well-to-do middle peasants were landlords
and rich peasants, who gave them support, sometimes openly, sometimes secretly.
On the side of the co-operatives stood the Communist Party members, who should
be as firm in their support for the co-operatives as were the Communists
in Nantsuichuang Village, Anyang County. It's a pity that not all the rural Party
branches were so firm. And where they were not, confusion arose. First of
all, there was the question of public opinion on whether chicken feathers
could fly up to heaven. It is of course a question of great importance. In
thousands of years, who had ever seen chicken feathers flying up to heaven?
That they could not seemed a truism. Many a poor or lower-middle peasant
would have been confused if the Party had not refuted this truism. Secondly,
as for cadres and<B>, </B>thirdly, as for such material resources as loans,
the co-operatives would have run into great difficulties if the Party and
the state had not<B> </B>come to their aid. The well-to-do middle peasants
dared to spread such hoary truisms as "chicken feathers can't fly up to heaven"
because<B> </B>the co-operatives had not increased their output, the poor
co-operatives had not become rich ones, and the co-operatives had not grown
in number from a few isolated ones to tens and hundreds of thousands. They
dared to do so because the Party had not yet conducted vigorous nation-wide
propaganda about the advantages of co-operation and because the Party had
not yet pointed out in clear-cut terms that the hoary truism "chicken feathers
can't fly up to heaven" no longer holds good in the era of socialism. The
poor are turning their past upside down. The old system is dying, a new system
is being born. Chicken feathers really are flying up to heaven. In the Soviet
Union, this has already happened. In China, it is happening now. And it is
going to happen all over the world. Many of our local Party organizations
were not solely to blame for failing to give strong backing to the badly-off
peasants because, higher up, opportunist ideas had not yet been dealt mortal
blows, comprehensive plans had not been made to promote cooperative
transformation and more effective leadership had not been given to the movement
on a national scale. In 1955 we did all this and in the space of a few months
the situation changed completely. Onlookers before, large numbers of people
now came over in groups to the side of the co-operatives. The well-to-do
middle peasants also changed their tune. Some applied to join the co-operatives
and others were getting ready to do so. Even the most stubborn among them
no longer dared talk about whether chicken feathers could fly up to heaven.
The landlords and rich peasants were completely deflated. The fact that the
People's Government punished a number of counter-revolutionaries who had
disrupted public order and tried to sabotage the co-operative transformation
also played a part here. In short, in the second half of 1955, a fundamental
change took place in the balance of class forces in our country: socialism
soared and capitalism plunged. Given another year of hard work in 1956, the
foundation will have been basically laid for the socialist transformation
in the transition period.

The almost ubiquitous Right opportunists inside the Party who hinder the
masses of poor and lower-middle peasants from taking the road of co-operation
act in concert with the forces of capitalism in our society. This article
gives an apt description of the situation. The author lashes out with great
indignation at the opportunists and champions those peasants who are badly
off. Some people are supposed to be Communists, but they show hardly any
interest in the socialist tasks that have to be undertaken now. Instead of
supporting the enthusiastic masses, they pour cold water on them. Nineteen
fifty-five has been the decisive year for the struggle between socialism
and capitalism in China. The decisive battle unfolded first of all in the
three conferences called in May, July and October by the Central Committee
of the Chinese Communist Party. In the first half of 1955 the atmosphere
was foul and dark clouds threatened. But in the second half of the year there
has been a complete change and the climate is entirely different; in response
to the call of the Central Committee tens of millions of peasant households
have swung into action and gone co-operative. At the time the editor is writing
these lines, over sixty million peasant households have joined co-operatives
all over the country. This is a raging tidal wave sweeping away all demons
and monsters. People of all sorts in our society have been clearly revealed
for what they are. It is the same in the Party. By the end of this year the
victory of socialism will be largely assured. Of course, many more battles
lie ahead and further efforts must be made to carry on the fight<B>.</B>

This is an interesting article too. Opportunists trying to stem the tide
are found almost everywhere, but the tide can never be stemmed, and socialism
is advancing triumphantly everywhere, sweeping away all obstacles. Society
progresses daily in this way and people's thinking is transformed in the
process, particularly when there is an upsurge in the revolution.

This article tells a moving story. We hope the reader will go through it
carefully. Those comrades who do not believe the peasant masses are eager
to take the socialist road and those comrades who are only too ready to pick
up the axe to "chop" the co-operatives are particularly urged to do so.
Throughout the countryside the socialist factors are growing daily and hourly,
the peasant masses are pressing to form co-operatives and large numbers of
intelligent, capable, fair-minded and enthusiastic leaders are emerging from
among the people; this is a very heartening situation indeed. The most serious
failing is that in many places the Party leaders have not bestirred themselves
to keep pace. Our present task is to get the local Party committees at various
levels to take the initiative on this matter in conformity with the
Marxist-Leninist stand, assume full responsibility for agricultural co-operation
and lead the movement forward with enthusiasm, warm responsiveness and drive.
The story of Lord Yeh who professed to love dragons should not be repeated,
one must not just talk about socialism for years and then suddenly turn pale
when socialism comes knocking at the door.

of the Leadership")
<h4>
<B>9</B></h4>
<P>
The correct line is being followed in this township, which already has five
agricultural producers' co-operatives, seven combined mutual-aid teams, three
permanent mutual-aid teams and fourteen temporary mutual-aid teams. This
means the total membership amounts to 98.4 per cent of the peasant households
which ought to be organized. Before December 1954, this township Party branch
did not lay stress on the mutual-aid and co-operative movement in exercising
its leadership, and Party members were afraid of difficulties in leading
the mutual-aid teams. Instead of "the Party secretary pitching in and all
Party members helping run the co-ops", this Party branch leaned on the work
team (apparently sent from above). In the whole country, there are quite
a few rural Party branches just as weak and incompetent on the question of
agricultural co-operation. Apart from these Party branches, it is quite possible
that some of the higher Party committees are also in this state. There's
the rub. Whether the socialist transformation of agriculture can keep pace
with the industrialization of the country and whether the co-operative movement
can develop in a healthy way with a minimum of shortcomings and a guaranteed
increase in production depends on whether the local Party committees at various
levels can quickly and correctly shift the emphasis of their leadership to
agricultural co-operation. Work teams should be sent in, but it must be made
clear that they are there only to help the local Party organizations, not
to take their place and render them idle and completely dependent. This township
in Kweichow Province achieved remarkable success in only a little over five
months after the leadership changed its approach to work in December 1954.
Instead of being dependent on the work team, they pitched in themselves,
and Party members stopped being afraid of difficulties. A change of this
sort depends first and foremost on the secretaries of the Party committees
at all levels -- province and autonomous region, prefecture and autonomous
prefecture, county and autonomous county, and district -- as well as on the
Party branch secretaries; they themselves must assume full responsibility
for agricultural co-operation. To be afraid of trouble and difficulties and
to refuse to pitch in when confronted with this great task but instead simply
to pass it on to the Party's rural work departments or to the<B> </B>work
teams -- such an attitude will not only make it impossible to accomplish
the task but will also cause a great deal of trouble.

<P>
The author of this article says it was after a joint meeting of co-operative
directors in the county that this co-operative developed the practice of
seasonal contracts from that of occasional contracts. From this one can see
that county leadership is very important. We hope that the leading body in
each of China's well over two thousand counties will closely watch the
development of its co-operative movement, identify the problems, work out
solutions to them, call timely meetings of the directors of all its co-operatives
or of selected ones, make decisions and carry them out quickly. Don't wait
until problems pile up and cause a lot of trouble before you tackle them.
Leaders must be in the van of the movement, not lag behind it. Within each
county, it is the county Party committee that should play the main role in
giving leadership.

This material is very convincing. Healthy co-operative transformation in
a locality depends on the Party's policies and methods of work. If our Party's
policies for co-operative transformation are correct, if its method of work
in mobilizing the masses to join co-operatives is not high-handed or simplistic,
but one of explaining and analysing things to the masses and relying entirely
on their initiative and willingness, then it should not be very difficult
to achieve co-operative transformation and raise output. Tungchuankou Village,
Hsingtai County, Hopei Province, lies in an old liberated area. Before 1952
the seventy households in the village had all joined mutual-aid teams and
they had a strong Party branch and in Wang Chih-chi a leader who enjoyed
the trust of the masses. All the conditions were ripe. So in 1952 the village
organized a co-operative, accomplishing semi-socialist co-operative
transformation in barely over a month. What about places where conditions
are not as ripe as in this village? Then it is a question of creating the
conditions and this can be done in a few months, a year, or a little longer.
The required conditions can be created while the work is being carried on.
To set up a few small co-operatives is to create the conditions for the
co-operative transformation of the whole village, the whole township and
the whole district. This material about Tungchuankou also explains at length
how a Party branch should conduct propaganda and education among the masses
and how it should rely on the initiative and willingness of the masses themselves
to establish co-operatives. The method of "reverse
propaganda"<B>[<A HREF="#bm2">2</A>]</B> used in this village is well worth
paying attention to. The material describes how the co-operative traversed
a zigzag course in tackling the problems of organizing and supervising labour
and went on to achieve great success in increasing production from year to
year. Facts have proved that this co-operative is sound. The main criterion
by which every co-operative judges whether it is sound is to see whether
its production is rising and by how much.

(Note to "The Whole Village Goes Co-operative in Barely over a Month")

This material points to the truth that any co-operative in a state of confusion
can be put in order. Since co-operative members are all working peasants,
whatever the differences among the various strata, they can be ironed out
in the end. For a time there really was confusion in some co-operatives,
solely because they got no leadership from the Party which did not explain
its policies and measures to the masses. "We know it's a good thing to set
up a co-opt But when we did set one up, nobody bothered about us, neither
the county Party committee, nor the district Party committee, nor the local
Party branch. Perhaps they didn't think much of our poor village, they couldn't
eat and live well here, and so they never came our way." This, and this alone,
accounts for such confusion as exists. Without leadership from the Party,
confusion naturally arises. The moment leadership is given, confusion will
end. This material also raises the question of whether co-operatives can
be established in backward villages. The answer is "yes". The very co-operative
the author describes lies in a backward village. Something like 5 per cent
of China's villages are backward; we must set up co-operatives in all these
villages and in the course of this struggle wipe out their backwardness.
<p class="sig">
(Note to "A Co-operative in a State of Confusion Is Put in Order")
<h4>

<P>
This is a common but serious problem. Party committees at every<B> </B>level
and comrades sent to guide the work of co-operative transformation in the
rural areas should give it their full attention. It is imperative to establish
the dominant position of the present-day poor peasants and the new lower-middle
peasants in the leading body of a co-operative, with the old lower-middle
peasants and the new and old upper-middle peasants as the auxiliary force;
only thus can unity between the poor and the middle peasants be attained,
the co-operatives be consolidated, production be expanded and socialist
transformation in the entire countryside be correctly carried out in line
with the Party's policy. In the absence of this condition, it is impossible
to attain unity between the middle and the poor peasants, consolidate the
co-operatives, expand production and achieve socialist transformation in
the entire countryside. Many comrades fail to understand this point. They
maintain that in the period of agrarian reform it was necessary to establish
the dominant position of the poor peasants, because the poor peasants, who
then accounted for 50, or 60 to 70 per cent of the rural population, had
not yet moved up to the status of middle peasants, while the middle peasants
were wavering with regard to agrarian reform, and so the necessity was indeed
real. They argue that we are now in the period of the socialist transformation
of agriculture and most of the former poor peasants have become new middle
peasants and that, moreover, the old middle peasants own plenty of the means
of production and without their participation it is impossible for the
co-operatives to cope with the shortage of the means of production. Therefore,
these comrades maintain that we should no longer raise the slogan of relying
on the poor peasants or establishing their dominant position and that this
slogan is harmful to the co-operative movement. This view, we believe, is
wrong. If the working class and the Communist Party are to bring about a
thorough transformation of the small peasant private ownership of the means
of production in the entire countryside in accordance with the socialist
spirit and the socialist system, they can do so relatively smoothly only
by relying on the masses of the poor peasants, the former semi-proletarians,
otherwise it will be most difficult. For the rural semi-proletariat are not
so stubborn in clinging to small peasant private ownership of the means of
production; they are more ready to accept socialist transformation. Most
of them have now become new middle peasants, but except for a section who
have become well-to-do, the majority of the new middle peasants have a higher
level of political consciousness than the old middle peasants, as they can
easily recall their past misery. Then there are the old lower-middle peasants,
in economic status and political attitude, they are more or less similar
to the new lower-middle peasants but different from the new and old upper-middle
peasants, i.e., the well-to-do or fairly well-to-do middle peasants. Therefore,
in the course of co-operative transformation we must pay attention to (1)
the poor peasants, who are still in difficulty, (2) the new lower-middle
peasants, and (3) the old lower-middle peasants -- the three sections who
are more ready to accept socialist transformation. They should be the first
ones to be drawn into the co-operatives, batch by batch and stage by stage;
a number of them with higher political consciousness and greater organizational
ability should be selected and trained as the mainstay of the leadership
of the co-operatives, and there should be special emphasis on selecting them
from among the present-day poor peasants and the new lower-middle peasants.
This does not mean a new determination of class status is to be made in the
rural areas; it is a policy to be carefully followed in the course of
co-operative transformation by the Party branches and the comrades sent to
the countryside to guide the work, and this policy should be publicly explained
to the peasant masses. Nor do we mean to keep the well-to-do middle peasants
out of the co-operatives; what we do mean is to admit them only when they
have raised their socialist consciousness and are willing to join<EM> </EM>and
accept the leadership of the poor peasants (including the present-day poor
peasants and all the new lower-middle peasants who were formerly poor peasants),
and not to set eyes on their oxen and farm implements and force them to join
when they are unwilling. Those already in co-operatives may stay on if they
wish. Those who have asked to withdraw but have been persuaded to change
their minds may also stay on. Co-operatives can be organized even with scanty
means of production, as has been proved by the many co-operatives organized
by poor and lower-middle peasants. Furthermore, we do not mean that none
of the well-to-do middle peasants should be allowed to serve as co-operative
cadres. A few well-to-do middle peasants, who are well thought of by the
majority of co-operative members for their higher level of socialist
consciousness, fair-mindedness and competence, may serve as cadres. However,
it is imperative to establish the dominant position of the poor peasants
in the co-operatives (to repeat, they include the present-day poor peasants
and all the new lower-middle peasants who were formerly <EM>poor </EM>peasants,
and together they constitute the majority, or the overwhelming majority,
of the rural population). As for the composition of the leading body, the
poor peasants should account for some two-thirds, while the middle peasants
(including the old lower-middle peasants and the new and old upper-middle
peasants) should form about one-third, but no more. As for the guiding principle,
the co-operatives must pursue policies beneficial to both the poor and the
middle peasants and not harmful to the interests of either. For this purpose,
too, it is necessary to establish the dominant position of the poor peasants.
In co-operatives where the middle peasants occupy the dominant position,
the poor peasants are usually pushed aside and their interests violated.
The experience of Kaoshan Township, Changsha County, Hunan Province, fully
shows that it is imperative and possible to establish the dominant position
of the poor peasants and thereby firmly to unite with the middle peasants,
and how dangerous it can be if this is not done. The author of this article
thoroughly understands the Party line. And the procedure is also a correct
one, that is, first of all fulfilling the urgent task of increasing production
and then establishing the dominant position of the poor peasants in the
leadership. As a result, the poor peasants did themselves proud and the middle
peasants were impressed too. The author also tells us something very important.
Is it better to dissolve a co-operative that is in a state of confusion or
give it a good shake-up and help it to get out of the confusion and on to
a sound basis? Is it possible to put such a co-operative in order and consolidate
it? He very convincingly tells us that instead of dissolving Class III
co-operatives we should set about putting them in order. After such an effort,
it is entirely possible for Class III co-operatives to become Class I
co-operatives. This experience is shared by many other places in the country
and is not peculiar to Kaoshan Township, Changsha County.

The problem discussed here is of general significance. It is essential to
unite with the middle peasants, and it is wrong not to do so. But who should
the working class and the Communist Party rely on in the rural areas in order
to unite with the middle peasants and achieve socialist transformation in
the entire countryside? Surely none other than the poor peasants. That was
the case in the past when the struggle was waged against the landlords to
carry out agrarian reform, and that is the case today when the struggle is
being waged against the rich peasants and other capitalist elements to achieve
the socialist transformation of agriculture. In both these revolutionary
periods the middle peasants wavered in the initial stage. Only when the middle
peasants see clearly which way the wind is blowing and only when victory
in the revolution is within sight will they come in on the side of the
revolution. The poor peasants have to work on the middle peasants and win
them over, so that the revolution will broaden from day to day until final
victory is achieved. The management committees of the agricultural producers'
co-operatives today, like the peasant associations in the past, must draw
in the old lower-middle peasants and a number of the new and old upper-middle
peasants who are representative of this stratum and have a relatively high
level of political consciousness, but there should not be too many of them
on the committee, one-third is about the right proportion. The other two-thirds
should be poor peasants (including the present-day poor peasants and the
new lower-middle peasants who were formerly poor peasants). Generally speaking,
the key posts in the co-operative should be held by the poor peasants (to
repeat, including the present-day poor peasants and all the new lower-middle
peasants who were formerly poor peasants), but such posts may also be filled
by old lower-middle peasants and some of the new and old upper-middle peasants
who have a high level of political consciousness and are really fair-minded
and competent. In Fuan County, Fukien Province, a co-operative led by the
poor peasants and another led by the middle peasants take different attitudes
towards the cause of socialism; this is true everywhere and should not be
regarded as an isolated phenomenon.

This material is useful and worth general attention. It describes the trends
among the various strata in the countryside. The poor peasants are the most
enthusiastic about co-operative transformation Many middle peasants want
to "wait and see for a while" and would like to "stay outside and be free",
mainly because they want to find out whether they would get a bad bargain
if they invested their means of production in the co-operatives; they can
swing either way. Many well-to-do middle peasants have strong feelings against
co-operation, the worst among them sell off their means of production, spirit
their money away, or rig up fake co-operatives, and a few even gang up with
landlords and rich peasants. We hope that all the comrades engaged in rural
work will carefully observe and analyse the trends among the various strata
in their localities so as to adopt policies suited to the circumstances.
This material mentions the mistaken tendency of paying attention to the
co-operatives to the neglect of the mutual-aid teams and recommends over-all
planning and all-round consideration, and this is correct. The "network of
mutual aid and co-operation" is a good idea, which takes into consideration
both the co-operatives and the mutual-aid teams, with the co-operatives providing
real help to the mutual-aid teams and peasants working on their own in solving
their current production difficulties. The poor peasants' fund must be made
available to the villages at once. Those poor peasants who have not yet joined
the co-operatives should be told that they can draw on this fund whenever
they join.

The policy of this co-operative is correct. All co-operatives should do the
same. In their resolutions or directives on the question of co-operative
transformation, the provinces should point out that it is the responsibility
of all co-operatives to help solve the difficulties of the widows, orphans
and other members without a provider, who have no labour-power (it was right
to admit such people), and also of those members who have labour-power but
are suffering great hardship. At present there are quite a number of
co-operatives in which the socialist spirit of helping needy families is
lacking and from which the poor peasants are even excluded; this is utterly
wrong. The government has now set up a poor peasants' fund which can help
them solve the problems of oxen and farm implements but cannot as yet solve
the problems of some poor peasant families short of labour-power, or solve
entirely the problems of some other families short of food before the new
harvest. These problems can be solved only by relying on the strength of
the masses in the co-operatives.

This is a very interesting story. Socialism, which is new, comes into being
only through severe struggle against what is old. At one time, a section
of society is very stubborn in following a set routine. At another, the very
same people are quite capable of changing their attitude and favouring the
new. In the first half of 1955, most of the well-to-do middle peasants were
still opposed to co-operation, but in the second half a number of them changed
their minds and expressed a desire to join the co-operatives, although some
did so because they hoped to obtain the leadership of the co-operatives.
Another group wavered a great deal, they said they wanted to join, but at
heart they were reluctant. A third group were obdurate and still wanted to
wait and see. On this matter the rural Party organizations should be patient
with this stratum and give them time. In order to establish the dominant
position of the poor and new lower-middle peasants in the leading bodies,
it may well prove to be an advantage if some of the well-to-do middle peasants
join the co-operatives a little later.

Political work is the life-blood of all economic work. This is particularly
true at a time when the social and economic system is undergoing fundamental
change. From the start, the agricultural co-operative movement has been a
severe ideological and political struggle. No co-operative can be established
without going through such a struggle. Before a new social system can be
built on the site of the old, the site must be swept clean. Remnant old ideas
reflecting the old system invariably persist in people's minds for a long
time, and they do not easily give way. Having been established, a co-operative
must go through many more struggles before it can be consolidated. Even then,
it may collapse if efforts are relaxed. A case in point is the Sanlouszu
Co-operative in Hsiehyu County, Shansi Province, which nearly collapsed for
lack of sustained effort after it had been consolidated. Not until the Party
branch of the co-operative had criticized its own errors, resumed education
for socialism and against capitalism among the co-operative members and revived
its political work was the crisis overcome and the co-operative able to grow
again. To oppose spontaneous tendencies towards capitalism which is characterized
by selfishness and to foster the socialist spirit which postulates the principle
of integrating collective interest with individual interest as the criterion
for judging all words and deeds -- these are the ideological and political
guarantees for the gradual transition from a scattered small peasant economy
to a large-scale co-operative economy. This entails doing an enormous amount
of hard work, not in a crude and oversimplified way, but concretely and
painstakingly in the light of the peasants' own experience. It should proceed
together with and not apart from economic work. We now have fairly rich
experience in this kind of work on a national scale. This is shown in almost
every article in this book.

This is a very good account of how to consolidate a co-operative and should
be recommended. The birth of a new social system is invariably accompanied
by cheering and shouting, that is to say, by propagating the superiority
of the new system and criticizing the backwardness of the old. It is impossible
to carry out in an atmosphere of tranquillity such an earth-shaking task
as getting some 500 million Chinese peasants to undertake socialist
transformation; therefore it behoves us Communists to conduct patient, lively
and easily understandable propaganda and education among the peasant masses
who are weighed down with the burdens of the old system. This is now being
done in every part of the country and many of the comrades engaged in rural
work have proved themselves good propagandists. The method described in this
article, "make four comparisons and five
calculations",<B>[<A HREF="#bm3">3</A>]</B> is a fine one for explaining
to the peasants, in terms easy to understand, which system is good and which
bad. It has great powers of persuasion. It is quite unlike the method of
those comrades who are not so good at propaganda work and can produce nothing
convincing but merely say, "Either you follow the road of the Communist Party,
or you follow the road of Chiang Kai-shek," thus trying to subdue their audience
by threatening to stick labels on them. It is a method that draws on the local
peasants' own experience and provides them with a detailed analysis; hence
its great powers of persuasion.

Sabotage of the co-operative movement by counter-revolutionaries is a common
occurrence and not limited to the Fifth District of Tuyun County, Kweichow
Province, but very little is written about it in simile publications in other
provinces. In the course of co-operative transformation, all comrades engaged
in rural work must pay full attention to the struggle against
counter-revolutionary wrecking activities. As in this district in Tuyun County,
security units with Party and Youth League members as the mainstay should
be set up within the co-operatives. It is absolutely necessary for the district
Party committee, led and supervised by the county Party committee, to study
the situation, carry out propaganda and explain things to people inside and
outside the Party, alert the masses to counter-revolutionary wrecking activities,
and then investigate, clear out and punish the counter-revolutionaries and
other bad elements who have wormed their way into the leading bodies of the
co-operatives. However, those to be cleared out must be confirmed
counter-revolutionaries and bad elements; good persons or persons merely
with certain shortcomings must not be labelled bad elements. In particular,
punishment must be appropriate and has to be approved by the county authorities.

This is an excellent article which can serve as reference material for all

They are the most eager to learn and the least conservative in their thinking,
and this is especially true in the era of socialism. We hope that the Party
organizations in all places, working in concert with the Youth League
organizations, will pay particular attention to bringing the energy of our
youth into full play, and not just take them for granted and ignore their
characteristics. Of course, the young should learn from the older people
and try as far as possible to win their agreement for doing useful things.
Older people are more encumbered with conservative ideas and often restrain
the progressive activities of the young; they will not be convinced until
the young people make a success of something. All this is very well described
in the article. Naturally, there should be no compromise with conservative
ideas. Well then, let's have a try at it, and if it works, they'll agree.

of stereotyped Party writing. Here we should like to call the reader's attention
to the fact that many of our comrades are addicted to stereotyped Party writing
and that the articles they turn out are not lively, not vivid, and give the
reader a headache. They care little for syntax or diction, and they fancy
a style that is a cross between the literary and the colloquial, at times
verbose and rambling, at times elliptical and archaic, as though they were
out to torment the reader. Quite a number of the more than 170 articles selected
for this book reeked heavily of stereotyped Party writing. Only after repeated
polishing were they made fairly readable. Even so, a few remain rather obscure
and hard to understand. They have been included only for their content. How
much longer will it be before we read less of this stereotyped Party writing
which gives us such headaches? It is up to those comrades who work as editors
on our newspapers and periodicals to pay attention to this matter, ask their
contributors to write coherently and vividly, and take it upon themselves
to polish the manuscripts.

The co-operative introduced here is the "paupers' co-op" led by Wang Kuo-fan.
Diligence and thrift ought to be the principle for managing all our agricultural
producers' co-operatives, nay, all our economic enterprises. Diligence and
thrift should be practiced in running factories, stores and all state-owned,
co-operative and other enterprises; this principle should be observed in
doing everything. It is the principle of practicing economy, one of the basic
principles of socialist economy. China is a big country but it is still very
poor, and it will take several decades to make China prosperous. Even then
the principle of diligence and thrift will still have to be observed, but
it is in the coming decades, in the span of several five-year plans, that
diligence and thrift must be particularly stressed and special attention
paid to practicing economy. At present, many co-operatives pay little attention
to practicing economy; this is an unhealthy tendency which should be immediately
corrected. Co-operatives run with diligence and thrift can be found in every
province and county, and these examples should be publicized for all to follow.
Those co-operatives which are industrious and thrifty, get the highest yields
and do well in all respects should be commended, whereas those which are
wasteful, get very low yields and do poorly in all respects should be criticized.

This township has made a two-year plan for co-operative transformation, increased

organizations, cultural and educational work, etc., and so should every township
in China. Some people say plans are hard to make, then how did this township
manage it? In 1956 every county, district and township in our country should
draw up a comprehensive plan, which should include more items than the above
plan, items such as side-line production, trade, finance, afforestation and
health work. Even if the plan is a bit crude and not quite in accord with
actual conditions, it is better than none. If one or two counties, districts
and townships in a province can produce fairly good plans, these can be
immediately publicized and serve as models for other counties, districts
and townships. Planning is said to be hard, but actually it's not so hard.

In its over-all planning every county should map out an appropriate plan
for water conservancy. Water conservancy is an important measure to ensure
increased agricultural production, small projects are well within the capacity
of every county, district, township and co-operative, and it is therefore
most necessary for plans to be drawn up and carried out in stages over a
number of years to ensure irrigation in times of drought and drainage in
times of water-logging, barring extraordinary and uncontrollable floods and
droughts. This is certainly practicable. Organized in co-operatives, the
masses have immense strength. Insoluble for thousands of years, the problems
of ordinary floods and droughts can now be solved in a matter of a few years.

Pig-raising is an important matter which has a direct bearing on the provision
of fertilizer, meat supply and the earning of foreign exchange from exports;
therefore all co-operatives should include the raising of pigs in their plans,
and naturally the provinces, prefectures, counties and districts should all
have their own plans. Pig-feed is readily available; some kinds of grass
and tree leaves, sweet potatoes and their vines are all pig-feed, and it
need not necessarily be grain, still less a lot of it. Apart from collective
pig-raising by co-operatives, every peasant household should be advised to
raise one or more pigs, and this goal is to be attained by stages in a few
years. Of course exceptions should be made in the case of some minority
nationality communities where pig-raising is taboo and of some families
which object to raising pigs on religious grounds. A set of measures should
be devised to reward pig-raising and the experience of the Shanghua Co-operative
in Chekiang Province can serve for the reference of all localities.

Before the co-operative transformation of agriculture, surplus<B>
</B>labour-power was a problem in many parts of the country. Since then many
co-operatives have felt the pinch of a labour shortage and the need to mobilize
the masses of women, who did not work in the fields before, to take their
place on the labour front. This was a major development that came as a surprise
to many people. People had generally expected a surplus of labour-power in
the wake of co-operation. A surplus already, and what if there should be
another one? In many places co-operation in practice has dispelled such
misgivings, as the problem has not been a surplus but a shortage of labour-power.
Some places did find a surplus of labour-power for a while following
co-operation, but that was because they had not yet extended the scale of
production, initiated diverse economic undertakings or started: intensive
cultivation. For many places the labour shortage becomes: evident as production
grows in scale, the number of undertakings increases, the efforts to remake
nature become more extensive and intensive and the work is done more thoroughly.
This is only the beginning, and it will become more evident as the years
go by. It will be the same after agriculture is mechanized. In the days to
come all kinds of enterprises undreamed of before will make their appearance
and agricultural output will rise several times, a dozen times, perhaps scores
of times, above the present level. The expansion of industry, communications
and exchange will defy the imagination of past generations. It will be the
same with science, culture, education and health work. Women form a great
reserve of labour-power in China. This reserve should be tapped in the struggle
to build a great socialist country. The principle of equal pay for equal
work for men and women must be enforced to encourage women to engage in
productive activity. All co-operatives can draw upon the experience of Chienteh
County in Chekiang Province.
<p class="sig">
(Note to "Labour Shortage Solved by Rallying Women to Join in Production")
<h4>
<B>35</B></h4>
<P>
This is also a common problem. The experience of these two co-operatives
shows that under present conditions of production there is already a surplus
of roughly one-third of the labour-power. What required three people in the
past can be done by two after co-operative transformation, an indication
of the superiority of socialism. Where can an outlet be found for this surplus
labour-power of one-third or more? For the most part, still in the countryside.
Socialism has not only liberated the working people and freed the means of
production from the shackles of the old society but has also released the
boundless resources of nature which the old society could not exploit. The
masses have unlimited creative power. They can organize themselves to take
on all spheres and branches of work where they can give full play to their
energy, tackle production more intensively and extensively and initiate more
and more undertakings for their own well-being. So far we have not touched
on the mechanization of agriculture. With mechanization, much more labour-power
can be saved. Will there be an outlet? Yes, there will be one, too, according
to the experience of certain mechanized state farms. As the scope of production
expands, the number of undertakings increases and the work is done more
intensively, there is no need to worry about labour-power not being put to
use.
<p class="sig">
(Note to "An Outlet Has Been Found for Surplus Labour-Power")
<h4>
<B>36</B></h4>
<P>
Things in this county also show us that an outlet can be found in the villages
for rural surplus labour-power. As management improves and the scope of
production expands, every able-bodied man and woman can put in more work-days
in the year. Instead of over one hundred work-days for a man and a few score
for a woman as described in this article, the former can put in well over
two hundred work-days an the latter well over one hundred or more. Some
co-operatives in other parts of the country have already reached that level.
Side-line production must have an assured market and not develop blindly
-- this is correct. Taking the country as a whole, rural side-line production
in a large measure caters to the countryside, but a fair part, which is likely
to expand in the future, must cater to the cities and meet export requirements.
The point is that the state must have a unified plan so as gradually to eliminate
blind development.

to train them quickly and raise their literacy level and vocational ability
in the course of their work. In each district organize the bookkeepers from
the producers', the supply and marketing and the credit co-operatives into
a bookkeepers' mutual-aid network -- this would be a good way to raise their
literacy and vocational levels. Such a network in Changwu County's Third
District has helped raise the bookkeepers' level in both these respects and
has done a lot of economic and political work besides. Party organizations
at the county and district levels must give their attention and guidance

The experience discussed here should be popularized. Lenin said that "a communist

country".<B>[<A HREF="#bm4">4</A>]</B> In our country today there are so
many illiterates, and yet the building of socialism cannot wait until illiteracy
is eliminated ; thus an acute contradiction arises. In our country today,
it is not only the many school-age children who have no schools to go to,
but also large numbers of young people above that age, to say nothing of
adults. This serious problem must be, and can only be, solved in the course
of agricultural co-operation. With the formation of co-operatives, the peasants
have a strong urge to learn to read and write out of economic necessity.
With the formation of co-operatives, the peasants have collective strength,
the situation changes completely and they can organize their own literacy
classes. First, to be able to record work-points, they must learn to write
the names of the persons and places in their village or township, the names
of farm implements, the terms for different kinds of farm work and other
indispensable words -- two or three hundred in all. Next, they must acquire
a bigger vocabulary. Two kinds of textbooks are thus needed. The first should
be compiled with the needs of the co-operatives in a particular locality
in mind by the local educated people with the help of the comrades guiding
the work of co-operation. Each locality should compile a textbook of its
own, and there should not be a uniform text for all. This textbook does not
need approval by the higher authorities. The second textbook, also with a
vocabulary of a few hundred words and to be compiled in the same manner,
should be based on things and expressions pertinent to a relatively limited
area (for instance, a county or prefecture), and in addition on certain things
and expressions of the province (or municipality or autonomous region) and
the whole country. This kind of textbook need not be uniform in all localities
either, but it should be examined promptly by the educational authorities
of the county, prefecture, or province (or municipality or autonomous region).
After these two steps, a third should be taken; this will require the educational
authorities of each province (or municipality or autonomous region) to prepare
a third textbook for general use. More advanced textbooks will subsequently
have to be compiled. The cultural and educational authorities at the national
level should give proper guidance in this matter. The Youth League branch
of Kaochialiukou Village, Chunan County, Shantung Province, has done something
creative. It is most gratifying to see how things are going there. They found
teachers among the graduates of their township primary school. Progress was rapid
with more than a hundred young people and adults learning over two hundred
words in two and a half months. They can now keep records of their own work-points
and some have become work-point recorders for the co-operative. "A course
for recording work-points" -- that's an apt name, too. Such courses should
be opened everywhere. Youth League organizations at every level should give
guidance to this work and all Party and government organizations should give
it their support.

This is about the Gold Star Agricultural, Forestry and Livestock Producers'
Co-operative led by Li Shun-ta. In the three years since its formation it
has grown into a large co-operative with 283 households. It is located in
a barren area in the Taihang Mountains, but by sheer hard work on the part
of all during these three years it has begun to take on a new look. The
utilization rate of labour-power is now 110.6 per cent higher than in the
days of individual farming before the anti-Japanese war and 74 per cent higher
than in the period of the mutual-aid teams before the co-operative was formed.
The co-operative's accumulation has increased from 120 yuan in its first
year to over 11,000 yuan. In 1955 each member received an average of 884
catties of grain, which is 77 per cent more than in the days before the
anti-Japanese war and 25.1 per cent more than in the mutual-aid team period.
This co-operative made a five-year plan, but after three years its total
output value is already 100.6 per cent of the target set by the plan. The
experience of this co-operative poses the following question to us<B>: </B>If
large increases in output can be attained in places where the natural conditions
are poor, why can't places where the natural conditions are more favourable
do even better?

This is a well managed co-operative. One can learn a great deal from its
valuable experience. Chufu County is Confucius' home town where the old man
ran a school for many years and trained a good number of capable disciples,
a fact that is quite well known. But he didn't care much about the economic
aspects of the life of the people. When his disciple Fan Chih asked him how
to do farming, he not only parried the question but abused Fan Chih behind
his back as belonging to "the lower orders".<B>[<A HREF="#bm5">5</A>]</B>
Now the people in his home town have set up socialist co-operatives. After
three years of co-operation, the economic and cultural life of the people,
who were poor and destitute for over two thousand years, has begun to change.
This demonstrates that the socialism of our time has indeed no parallel in
history. Socialism is infinitely superior to the Confucian "classics". I
would like to suggest to those interested in visiting the Temple and Tomb
of Confucius that on their way they might well go and have a look at the
co-operative described here.

This article is very well written and worth reading. Most of the existing
semi-socialist co-operatives are small, each with only twenty or thirty
households, because co-operatives of that size are easy to set up and give
the cadres and members an opportunity to gain experience quickly. But with
its few members, little land and scanty funds a small<B> </B>co-operative
cannot operate on a large scale or use machinery. Co-operatives so small
in size still hamper the development of the productive forces; they should
not remain at this stage for long, but should gradually merge. In some places
a single co-operative may embrace an entire township, in a few places several
townships, but, of course, in many others one township may have several
co-operatives. Big co-operatives can be formed in mountain areas as well
as on the plains. The township in Anhwei Province where the Futzuling Reservoir
is situated is all hills for dozens of <EM>li </EM>around. It is precisely
here that a big co-operative has been set up which goes in for agriculture,
forestry and livestock in a comprehensive way. Of course the amalgamation
of co-operatives should proceed step by step with the members' consent and
when suitable cadres are available.

The experience of the Red Flag Co-operative on Hainan Island has again
demonstrated the greater advantages of big co-operatives and co-operatives
of the advanced type. Only one year after its formation, this big co-operative
was ready to move on to the advanced stage. Of course, this is not to say
that all co-operatives should follow suit, for' they must first consider
whether their conditions are ripe before deciding when to merge and move
on to the advanced stage. But generally speaking, a period of three years
is about right. The important thing is to set examples for the peasants.
When they see that big co-operatives and co-operatives of the advanced type
yield greater advantages than small and elementary ones, they will want to
merge their co-operatives and move on to the advanced stage.

It is necessary to consider changing elementary co-operatives to advanced
ones when their conditions are ripe, so as to further develop their productive
forces and production. Since elementary co-operatives maintain a system of
semi-private ownership,<B>[<A HREF="#bm6">6</A>]</B> with the passage of
time this will hamper the development of the productive forces and people
will begin to demand a change in the system of ownership, so that the
co-operative will become a collectively managed economic unit in which the
means of production are owned wholly in common. Once the productive forces
are further freed, production will expand even more. Some places can make
the change-over fairly quickly, others will probably have to go a bit more
slowly. After functioning for about three years co-operatives of an elementary
type will in the main acquire the necessary conditions. The Party organizations
in every province, municipality and autonomous region should look into this
matter and make preparations, and during 1956 and 1957 establish a number
of experimental co-operatives of the advanced type with the consent of the
masses. In general, the co-operatives today are small, and when they switch
over to the advanced type, the many small co-operatives should be merged
into big ones with the consent of the masses. If in 1956 and 1957 every district
can get one or more such co-operatives organized and their superiority over
the elementary type is made plain to the masses, this will create favourable
conditions for co-operatives to merge and move on to the advanced stage in
the years to follow. This work must be co-ordinated with over-all planning
to expand production. When people see that big co-operatives and co-operatives
of the advanced type have greater advantages than small and elementary ones,
when people see that long-range planning brings a much higher level of material
and cultural life in its train, they will agree to merge their co-operatives
and move on to the advanced stage. The elevation to the advanced stage will
proceed more quickly in the suburban areas. The experience of this co-operative
in Peking can serve as reference material for other co-operatives with similar
conditions.

woefully short of means of production, Instead of asking for state loans,
the co-operative organized its members to go into the mountains some thirty
<EM>li </EM>away to collect firewood which they sold to pay for means of
production. So the co-operative members said that they "made the mountains

of the co-operatives with respect to (1) coping with natural disasters, (2)
increasing earnings through the promotion of side-lines, (3) increasing
workpoints by arousing enthusiasm for labour, (4) increasing production as
a result of mutually beneficial co-operation by the poor and the middle peasants,

maintained private ownership b the co-operative members of such means of
production as land, draught animals an the larger farm implements, and the
co-operative had to pay "dividends" to its men bets for their use. The elementary
co-operative was therefore said to have retainssemi-private ownership.
