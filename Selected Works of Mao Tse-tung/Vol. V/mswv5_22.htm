  LET US UNITE AND CLEARLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN OURSELVES AND THE ENEMY

[Salient points of a speech delivered at the thirty-eighth meeting of the
Standing Committee of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference.] 
  <hr class="end" />
<P>
We have been simultaneously waging war, holding negotiations and working
towards stability for a whole year.
<P>
The war situation in Korea became stable after July last year, but at the
time we were not sure whether the financial and economic situation at home
could be stabilized. We had said, "Prices are basically stable and revenues
and expenditures are almost balanced," meaning that prices could not yet
be stabilized and that revenues and expenditures were not yet balanced.
Expenditures were in excess of revenues, and that was a problem. That is
why the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting
last September and called for increased production and strict economy. In
October, I repeated this call at the Third Session of the First National
Committee of the Political Consultative Conference. The subsequent campaign
to increase production and practice economy brought to light rather serious
cases of corruption, waste and bureaucracy. In December the movement against
the "three evils" was launched, and this was followed by the movement against
the "five evils". Both these movements have come to a successful conclusion,
the situation is now perfectly clear and general stability has been achieved.
<P>
Last year, what we spent on the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea
more or less equalled our expenditures for national construction; it was
fifty-fifty. This year it will be different. It is estimated that the outlays
for war will come to only half last year's figure. Our troops are fewer in
number but they are better equipped. For more than two decades we fought
without an air force and we were always on the receiving end of enemy bombing.
Now we have an air force of our own, and anti-aircraft guns, artillery and
tanks too. The war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is a big school
for large-scale military exercises, and such exercises are better than a
military academy. If the fighting continue, through next year, all our land
forces will have had their spell of military training in Korea.
<P>
In this war we were confronted with three problems at the start: first, our
ability to fight, second, our ability to hold out and, third, our ability
to feed ourselves.
<P>
The problem of our ability to fight was solved within the first two or three
months. The enemy had more artillery, but their morale was low; they were
rich in metal but poor in morale.
<P>
The problem of our ability to hold out was also solved last year. Our answer
was to dig tunnels. We constructed two tiers of defence works. When the enemy
attacked, we got into the tunnels. Sometimes the enemy occupied the positions
overhead, but what lay below remained in our hands. When they were in our
positions, we counter-attacked, inflicting heavy casualties on them. We used
this homespun method to collect foreign guns. The enemy was entirely at a
loss as to how to cope with us.
<P>
It was quite some time before the problem of food supplies, that is, the
problem of ensuring provisions, was solved. At first we did not know that
tunnels could be dug to store grain in. Now we know. Each division has grain
reserves for three months, its own storage area and a meeting hall to boot,
and our men are making a go of life in the tunnels.
<P>
Today, our policy is clear and definite, our positions are secure, our provisions
ensured, and every soldier knows that he must fight to the end.
<P>
Just how long will the fighting go on, and just when will the negotiations
draw to a close? I say negotiations will continue, fighting will go on but
there will be a truce.
<P>
Why is it that there will be a truce? A thirty years' war or a hundred years'
war is highly improbable, because a long war is very much against the interests
of the United States.
<P>
First, the war costs lives. They fought on to hold some ten thousand prisoners
of war, only to lose over thirty thousand more lives. After all, they have
far fewer men than we.
<P>
Second, the war costs money. They are spending far more than ten billion
U.S. dollars a year. We spend very much less, and this year we are going
to cut our expenditures to half last year's. The money that came from the
settling of accounts in the movements against the "three evils" and the "five
evils" can see us through another eighteen months of war. And all the money
that comes from increased production and the practice of economy can be used
for national construction.
<P>
Third, they are confronted with insuperable contradictions at home and abroad.
<P>
Fourth, there is the strategic problem too. The focus of U.S. strategy is
in Europe. They did not anticipate that we would send volunteers to aid Korea
when they dispatched forces to invade it.
<P>
With us, things are easier to manage. In internal affairs we are masters
of our own house. But we are not the chief of staff of the United States.
The United States has its own chief of staff. So on the question of whether
the Korean war will continue, we and the Koreans have only half the say.
<P>
In a word, under the pressure of the general trend, the United States will
find it against its interest to refuse to come to a truce.
<P>
All the talk about the imminence of a third world war is just to scare people.
We must strive to gain a period of ten years for building our industry and
laying solid foundations.
<P>
We must close our ranks and clearly distinguish between ourselves and the
enemy. It is because of the unity of the whole nation and the co-operation
of all those present and of all the democratic parties and people's organizations
that we are strong today. It is of vital importance that we unite and distinguish
between ourselves and the enemy. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was a man of integrity,
but why did the Revolution of 1911 he led end in failure? The reasons were<B>:
</B>first, failure to distribute land; second, failure to recognize the necessity
of suppressing counter-revolutionaries; and, third, failure to wage sharp
struggles against imperialism. Apart from distinguishing between ourselves
and the enemy, there is the need to distinguish between right and wrong within
our own ranks. Compared with the former, the latter is secondary. For instance,
with most of the embezzlers, it is just a matter of right and wrong, for
they are different from counter-revolutionaries and can be reformed.
<P>
It is necessary to carry out education among the democratic parties and in
religious circles so that they will not be taken in by the imperialists and
stand on the enemy's side. Take Buddhism for example. It has not much contact
with imperialism and its ties are chiefly with feudalism. As the struggle
against feudalism involves the land problem, it affects the monks, and those
who come under attack are the abbots and elders of the monasteries. Once
this small number is overthrown, ordinary monks like "Lu Chih-shen"<B>
[<A HREF="#bm1">1</A>]</B> will be emancipated. Though no believer in Buddhism,
I am not against forming an association of Buddhists to get them united and
enable them to distinguish clearly between the people and the enemy. Will
the united front be abolished some day? I for one am not for its abolition.
We should unite with everyone provided he truly makes a clear distinction
between the people and the enemy and serves the people.
<P>
Our country has a bright future and is full of hope. In the past we wondered
if the economy could recover in three years. As a result of two and a half
years of hard struggle, it already has, and what is more, planned construction
is under way. Let us all unite, clearly distinguish between ourselves and
the enemy and strive for the steady progress of our country.
