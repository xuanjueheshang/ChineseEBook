<P>
Please make certain that you strike surely, accurately and relentlessly in
suppressing the counter-revolutionaries.

One batch of bandit chieftains, local tyrants and secret agents has been
executed in twenty-one counties in western Hunan, and another batch is to
be executed by local authorities this year. I think measures of this kind
are absolutely necessary. For only thus can we deflate the enemy's arrogance
and raise the people's morale. If we are weak and irresolute, if we are tolerant
and indulgent, it will bring harm to the people and alienate us from the
masses.
<P>
To strike surely means to pay attention to tactics. To strike accurately
means to avoid wrong executions. To strike relentlessly means resolutely
to kill all such reactionary elements as deserve the death penalty (of course,
those who don't will not be executed). So long as we avoid wrong executions,
we don't have to worry even if the bourgeoisie raises an outcry.

In Shantung there is lethargy in some places and rashness in others. Generally
speaking, both these deviations are to be found in all the provinces and
cities in the country and attention should be paid to setting them right.
In particular, rashness presents the major danger. For by education and
persuasion those who are lethargic can eventually become active, and it doesn't
make much difference if a counter-revolutionary is put to death a few days
sooner or a few days later. But being rash and making wrong arrests and
executions will produce very bad effects. Please exercise strict control
over the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and be sure to proceed
with caution and correct any deviation of rashness in handling the job. We
must suppress all counter-revolutionaries, but on no account should we make
wrong arrests or executions.

In regard to the counter-revolutionaries ferreted out in the Communist Party,
People's Liberation Army and organs of the People's Government and in
educational, industrial and commercial and religious circles, democratic
parties and people's organizations, the Central Committee has decided as
follows. Whereas those whose crimes do not deserve the death penalty shall
be sentenced to life imprisonment or various prison terms or put under public
supervision and surveillance, with respect to all counter-revolutionaries
deserving capital punishment execution shall be confined to those who owe
blood debts, or who have committed other major crimes which evoke public
indignation, such as frequent rape or the plundering of large amounts of
property, or who have done extremely serious harm to the national interest,
while the policy towards the rest shall be one of passing the death sentence,
granting a two-year reprieve and subjecting them to forced labour during
this period to see how they behave. This is a prudent policy, a policy that
can avoid mistakes. It can win a favourable response from people in all walks
of life. It can disintegrate the counter-revolutionary forces and contribute
towards the thorough elimination of counter-revolution. Moreover, it can
save a large pool of labour-power, which will be conducive to our national
construction. Therefore, it is a correct policy. Of all the
counter-revolutionaries deserving death who are ferreted out in the
above-mentioned Party, government, military, educational, industrial and
commercial and people's organizations, it is estimated that those who owe
blood debts, those who have committed other crimes which evoke public indignation
and those who have done extremely serious harm to the national interest make
up only a small number, roughly 10 to 20 per cent, while those to be sentenced
to death but to be granted a reprieve probably account for 80 to 90 per cent,
that is to say, 80 to 90 per cent may be saved. These counter-revolutionaries
differ from the bandit chieftains, hardened brigands and local tyrants in
the rural areas, from the local tyrants, bandit chieftains, hardened brigands,
leaders of criminal gangs and heads of reactionary secret societies in the
cities, and also from certain secret agents who have done extremely serious
harm to the national interest in that they have contracted no blood debts
or committed no other major crimes that incur the deep hatred of the masses.
The harm they did to the national interest, while serious enough, had not
yet reached an extreme. They have committed capital offenses, but the masses
were not the direct victims. If we have such people executed, it will not
be easily understood by the masses, nor will the response from public figures
be so favourable; at the same time it will deprive us of a large pool of
labour-power and will not serve to split the enemy ranks; besides, we may
make mistakes on this question. Therefore, towards such persons the Central
Committee has decided on a policy of passing the death sentence with a reprieve
and subjecting them to forced labour to see how they behave. If some are
beyond reform and continue their wrongdoing, they can be executed later on,
as the initiative is in our hands. All the local authorities are asked to
adhere to the foregoing principle in dealing with the counter-revolutionaries
uncovered in the Party, government, military, educational, industrial and
commercial and people's organizations. As a precaution, the very small number
of executions to be carried out (amounting to roughly 10 to 20 per cent of
all those sentenced to death) must without exception be reported to the greater
administrative areas or the greater military areas for approval. As for prominent
figures whose execution might affect our united front work, approval must
be obtained from the central authorities. In the case of counter-revolutionaries
in the rural areas, we shall likewise put to death only those whose execution
is necessary to assuage the people's anger, and none shall be executed unless
the people so demand. To some we should similarly apply the policy of passing
the death sentence with a reprieve. But persons whose death is demanded by
the people must be executed so as to assuage their anger and help production.

<P>
In no circumstances should the policy of "granting a two-year reprieve" be
taken to mean not executing those criminals who owe blood debts or are guilty
of other major crimes when their execution is demanded by the people. This
would be wrong. We must make it clear to the district and village cadres
and the masses that persons who have incurred the bitter hatred of one and
all for their heinous crimes and have to be executed to assuage the people's
anger must be put to death for this purpose. It is only on those
counter-revolutionaries who are guilty of capital offences but have not incurred
deep popular hatred and whose execution is not demanded by the people that
we shall pass the death sentence with a two-year reprieve and impose forced
labour to see how they behave.

<h4>
<B>6</B></h4>
<P>
The work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries must be placed entirely under
the unified leadership of the Party committees at all levels, and the responsible
comrades of all public security and other organs associated with this work
must, as always, unreservedly accept this leadership.
