What Hu Feng calls "uniformity of public opinion" actually means that
counter-revolutionaries are not allowed to express counterrevolutionary views.
Indeed this is true, our system does deprive all counter-revolutionaries
of freedom of speech and allows this freedom only among the people. We allow
opinions to be varied among the people, that is, there is freedom to criticize,
to express different views and to advocate theism or atheism (i.e., materialism).
In any society and at any time, there are always two kinds of people and
views, the advanced and the backward, that exist as opposites struggling
with each other, with the advanced views invariably prevailing over the backward
ones; it is neither possible nor right to have "uniformity of public opinion".
Society can progress only if what is advanced is given full play and prevails
over what is backward. But in an era in which classes and class struggle
still exist both at home and abroad, the working class and the masses who
have seized state power must suppress the resistance to the revolution put
up by all counter-revolutionary classes, groups and individuals, thwart their
activities aimed at restoration and prohibit them from exploiting freedom
of speech for counter-revolutionary purposes. Thus Hu Feng and
counter-revolutionaries of his kind find "uniformity of public opinion"
inconvenient for them. Their inconvenience is exactly what we want and is
exactly what is convenient for us. Public opinion in our country is at once
uniform and non-uniform. Among the people, both the advanced and the backward
are free to use our newspapers, periodicals, forums, etc. to compete with
each other, so that the former can educate the latter by the democratic method
of persuasion and backward ideas and systems can be overcome. When a
contradiction is resolved, new contradictions emerge, and competition takes
place again. In this way, society constantly progresses. The existence of
contradictions means non-uniformity. The resolution of contradictions results
in temporary uniformity, but new contradictions soon emerge, which means
non-uniformity, and they, in turn, have to be resolved. As for the contradiction
between the people and the counter-revolutionaries, that is a matter of
dictatorship over the counter-revolutionaries by the people under the leadership
of the working class and the Communist Party. Here the dictatorial, not the
democratic method is used; in other words, the counter-revolutionaries must
behave themselves and are not allowed to be unruly in word or deed. In this
respect, it is not only public opinion that is uniform, but the law too.
On this question, the arguments of Hu Feng and other counter-revolutionaries
may seem plausible, and on hearing such counter-revolutionary remarks some
muddleheads feel themselves somewhat in the wrong. Well, you see, "uniformity
of public opinion", or "absence of public opinion", or "suppression of freedom"
-- don't they sound awful? These people cannot distinguish clearly between
two different categories, between what is within the ranks of the people
and what is without. Within the ranks of the people, it is criminal to suppress
freedom, to suppress the people's criticism of the shortcomings and mistakes
of the Party and the government or to suppress free discussion in academic
circles. This is our system. However, all this is legitimate in capitalist
countries. Outside the ranks of the people, it is criminal to allow
counter-revolutionaries to be unruly in word or deed and it is legitimate
to exercise dictatorship over them. This is our system. The opposite is true
of capitalist countries, where the bourgeoisie exercises a dictatorship under
which revolutionary people are not allowed to be "unruly in word or deed"
but must "behave themselves". Exploiters and counter-revolutionaries are
always and everywhere in the minority while the exploited and revolutionaries
are invariably in the majority. Therefore, dictatorship by the latter is
perfectly right, while dictatorship by the former is invariably wrong. Hu
Feng also said, "The great majority of readers belong to some organization
where the atmosphere is coercive." Among the people, we reject the coercive
method of commandism and adhere to the democratic method of persuasion; here
the atmosphere should be free, "coercion" is wrong. "The great majority of
readers belong to some organization" -- this is excellent. In thousands of
years nothing like this had ever happened. It was only after the Communist
Party led the people in waging a long and arduous struggle that they were
able to change to being united from being like loose sand, a condition which
favoured the reactionaries' exploitation and oppression, and that the people
achieved this great unity among themselves within a few years after victory
in the revolution. By "coercion" Hu Feng means our coercing those on the
side of counter-revolution. Yes, they tremble with fear, feeling "like the
miserable daughter-in-law always afraid of being beaten", or worrying that
"a mere cough is being recorded". We consider this excellent too. Nothing
like this had ever happened in thousands of years either. Only after the
Communist Party led the people through a long and arduous struggle were these
scoundrels made to feel so uncomfortable. In a word, the day of joy for the
people is a day of woe for the counter-revolutionaries. This, above all,
is what we celebrate each year when National Day comes around. Hu Feng also
said, "When it comes to literature and art, mechanism is really the easiest
thing." Here "mechanism" is a derogatory term for dialectical materialism,
and to call it "the easiest thing" is sheer nonsense. Idealism and metaphysics
are the easiest things in the world, because, being neither based on objective
reality nor submitted to its test, they permit people to talk as much nonsense
as they like. Materialism and dialectics, on the other hand, demand effort.
They must be based on and submitted to the test of objective reality<B>.
</B>Unless one makes the effort, one is liable to drift into idealism
and metaphysics. In his letter <B>[<A HREF="#bm1">1</A>]</B> Hu Feng raised
three questions of principle, which we have deemed it necessary to repudiate
at some length. In addition, Hu Feng wrote in the letter, "At present there
is a desire to resist everywhere, there are further demands everywhere";
this was in 1950. At the time, the bulk of Chiang Kai-shek's military forces
had just been wiped out on the mainland, many of the counter-revolutionary
armed forces who had turned into bandits were yet to be eliminated, the
large-scale movements of agrarian reform and suppression of
counter-revolutionaries had not yet begun, nor had the work of readjustment
in the fields of culture and education. What Hu Feng said did reflect the
situation then, but he left something unsaid. To spell it out, it should
have read: At present there is a desire on the part of counter-revolutionaries
to resist the revolution everywhere, there are further demands of all sorts
from counter-revolutionaries everywhere seeking to make trouble for the
revolution.
