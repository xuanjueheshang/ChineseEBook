  TAKE MUTUAL AID AND CO-OPERATION IN AGRICULTURE AS A MAJOR TASK
</h1><p><p class="title">
<EM>December 15, 1951</EM>
<P class="information">
[Inner-Party circular of historic significance to rebuff Liu Shao-chi's
opposition to the co-operative transformation of agriculture. In July 1951,
behind the backs of Comrade Mao Tsetung and the Party Central Committee,
Liu Shao-chi wrote and distributed a comment in his own name, wantonly attacking
a report submitted by the Shansi Provincial Party Committee on promoting
mutual aid and co-operation in agricultural production. In this comment,
he opposed Comrade Mao Tsetung's line on the socialist transformation of
agriculture, maligning it as an "erroneous, dangerous and utopian notion
of agrarian socialism". In September of the same year, Comrade Mao Tsetung
personally took charge of drafting the "Resolution of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China on Mutual Aid and Co-operation in Agricultural
Production (Draft)", and on December 15 when the draft resolution was to
be distributed he wrote this circular and instructed the whole Party to take
mutual aid and co-operation in agriculture as a major task.]

<P>
Herewith is the Draft Resolution on Mutual Aid and Co-operation in Agricultural
Production which you are requested to print for distribution right down to
the county and district Party committees. Please give prompt explanations
inside and outside the Party in the spirit of this draft and arrange for
its implementation. This is to be done in all areas where the agrarian reform
has been completed, and please take it as a major task. This draft resolution
may appear in inner Party publications but not in newspapers and periodicals
for general circulation, as it is still a draft. <A name="v5_19"></A>
