<h4>
<B>1</B></h4>
<P>
From now on, all documents and telegrams sent out in the name of the Central
Committee can be dispatched only after I have gone over them, <EM>otherwise
they are invalid. </EM>Please take note.
<h4>
<B>2</B></h4>
<P>
(1) Please assume responsibility for checking on the telegrams and documents
dispatched in the name of the Central Committee or the Military Commission
in the period from August 1<EM> </EM>last year (those issued before August
1 have been checked) to May 5 this year to see if there are any which I have
not gone over and if so how many (not counting those issued during my absence
on tours of inspection or on sick leave), and let me know the results.
<P>
(2) On several occasions resolutions adopted at meetings called by the Central
Committee, which I had not gone over, were issued without authorization.
This is a mistake and a breach of discipline.
