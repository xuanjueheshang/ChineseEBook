  NEW YEAR'S DAY MESSAGE
</h1><p><p class="title">
<EM>January 1, 1952</EM>
<P>
May all of us -- the cadres of the People's Government, the commanders and
fighters of the People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army, the
democratic parties, the people's organizations, the minority nationalities
and the people of the entire country -- win victory on every front of our
work!
<P>
May we win victory on the front of our movement to resist U.S. aggression
and aid Korea!
<P>
Victory on the national defence front!
<P>
Victory on the agrarian reform front!
<P>
Victory on the front of our movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries!
<P>
Victory on the economic and financial front!
<P>
Victory on the cultural and educational front!
<P>
Victory on the front of the ideological remoulding of people in all walks
of life, and primarily of the intellectuals!
<P>
I would also like to wish victory to a new front, that is, to the large-scale
struggle in which all the people and cadres of the country are called upon
to fight vigorously and resolutely against corruption, waste and bureaucracy,
so as to cleanse our society of all the filth and poison left over from the
old!
<P>
Comrades, in 1951 we scored victories, many of them very great ones, on all
these fronts. We hope that by our common efforts we shall win still greater
victories in all these tasks in 1952.
<P>
Long live the People's Republic of China! <A name="v5_20"></A>
