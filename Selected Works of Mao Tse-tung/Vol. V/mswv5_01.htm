[Opening address at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference.] 
  <hr class="end" />
<P>
Fellow Delegates,
<P>
The Political Consultative Conference so eagerly awaited by the whole nation
is herewith inaugurated.
<P>
Our conference is composed of more than six hundred delegates, representing
all the democratic parties and people's organizations of China, the People's
Liberation Army, the various regions and nationalities of the country and
the overseas Chinese. This shows that ours is a conference embodying the
great unity of the people of the whole country.
<P>
It is because we have defeated the reactionary Kuomintang government backed
by U.S. imperialism that this great unity of the whole people has been achieved.
In a little more than three years the heroic Chinese People's Liberation
Army, an army such as the world has seldom seen, crushed all the offensives
launched by the several million troops of the U.S.-supported reactionary
Kuomintang government and turned to the counter-offensive and the offensive.
At present the field armies of the People's Liberation Army, several million
strong, have pushed the war to areas near Taiwan, Kwangtung, Kwangsi, Kweichow,
Szechuan and Sinkiang, and the great majority of the Chinese people have
won liberation. In a little more than three years the people of the whole
country have closed their ranks, rallied to support the People's Liberation
Army, fought the enemy and won basic victory. And it is on this foundation
that the present People's Political Consultative Conference is convened.
<P>
Our conference is called the Political Consultative Conference because some
three years ago we held a Political Consultative Conference with Chiang
Kai-shek's Kuomintang.<B>[<A href="#bm1">1</A>]</B> The results of that
conference were sabotaged by Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang and its accomplices;
nevertheless the conference left an indelible impression on the people. It
showed that nothing in the interest of the people could be accomplished together
with Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, the running dog of imperialism, and its
accomplices. Even when resolutions were reluctantly adopted, it was of no
avail, for as soon as the time was ripe, they tore them up and started a
ruthless war against the people. The only gain from that conference was the
profound lesson it taught the people that there is absolutely no room for
compromise with Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, the running dog of imperialism,
and its accomplices -- overthrow these enemies or be oppressed and slaughtered
by them, either one or the other, there is no other choice. In a little more
than three years the Chinese people, led by the Chinese Communist Party,
have quickly awakened and organized themselves into a nation-wide united
front against imperialism, feudalism, bureaucrat-capitalism and their general
representative, the reactionary Kuomintang government, supported the People's
War of Liberation, basically defeated the reactionary Kuomintang government,
overthrown the rule of imperialism in China and restored the Political
Consultative Conference.
<P>
The present Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is convened
on an entirely new foundation; it is representative of the people of the
whole country and enjoys their trust and support. Therefore, the conference
proclaims that it will exercise the functions and powers of a National People's
Congress. In accordance with its agenda, the conference will enact the Organic
Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Organic
Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
and the Common Programme of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference; it will elect the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference and the Central People's Government Council
of the People's Republic of China; it will adopt the national flag and national
emblem of the People's Republic of China; and it will decide on the seat
of the capital of the People's Republic of China and adopt the chronological
system in use in most countries of the world.
<P>
Fellow Delegates, we are all convinced that our work will go down in the
history of mankind, demonstrating that the Chinese people, comprising one
quarter of humanity, have now stood up. The Chinese have always been a great,
courageous and industrious nation; it is only in modern times that they have
fallen behind. And that was due entirely to oppression and exploitation by
foreign imperialism and domestic reactionary governments. For over a century
our forefathers never stopped waging unyielding struggles against domestic
and foreign oppressors, including the Revolution of 1911 led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen,
our great forerunner in the Chinese revolution. Our forefathers enjoined
us to carry out their unfulfilled will. And we have acted accordingly. We
have closed our ranks and defeated both domestic and foreign oppressors through
the People's War of Liberation and the great people's revolution, and now
we are proclaiming the founding of the People's Republic of China. From now
on our nation will belong to the community of the peace-loving and freedom-loving
nations of the world and work courageously and industriously to foster its
own civilization and well-being and at the same time to promote world peace
and freedom. Ours will no longer be a nation subject to insult and humiliation.
We have stood up. Our revolution has won the sympathy and acclaim of the
people of all countries. We have friends all over the world.
<P>
Our revolutionary work is not completed, the People's War of Liberation and
the people's revolutionary movement are still forging ahead and we must keep
up our efforts. The imperialists and the domestic reactionaries will certainly
not take their defeat lying down; they will fight to the last ditch. After
there is peace and order throughout the country, they are sure to engage
in sabotage and create disturbances by one means or another and every day
and every minute they will try to stage a come-back. This is inevitable and
beyond all doubt, and under no circumstances must we relax our vigilance.
<P>
Our state system, the people's democratic dictatorship, is a powerful weapon
for safeguarding the fruits of victory of the people's revolution and for
thwarting the plots of domestic and foreign enemies for restoration, and
this weapon we must firmly grasp. Internationally, we must unite with all
peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and peoples, and first of all with
the Soviet Union and the New Democracies, so that we shall not stand alone
in our struggle to safeguard these fruits of victory and to thwart the plots
of domestic and foreign enemies for restoration. As long as we persist in
the people's democratic dictatorship and unite with our foreign friends,
we shall always be victorious.
<P>
The people's democratic dictatorship and solidarity with our foreign friends
will enable us to accomplish our work of construction rapidly. We are already
confronted with the task of nation-wide economic construction. We have very
favourable conditions: a population of 475 million people and a territory
of 9,600,000 square kilometres. There are indeed difficulties ahead, and
a great many too. But we firmly believe that by heroic struggle the people
of the country will surmount them all. The Chinese people have rich experience
in overcoming difficulties. If our forefathers, and we also, could weather
long years of extreme difficulty and defeat powerful domestic and foreign
reactionaries, why can't we now, after victory, build a prosperous and
flourishing country? As long as we keep to our style of plain living and
hard struggle, as long as we stand united and as long as we persist in the
people's democratic dictatorship and unite with our foreign friends, we shall
be able to win speedy victory on the economic front.
<P>
An upsurge in economic construction is bound to be followed by an upsurge
of construction in the cultural sphere. The era in which the Chinese people
were regarded as uncivilized is now ended. We shall emerge in the world as
a nation with an advanced culture.
<P>
Our national defence will be consolidated and no imperialists will ever again
be allowed to invade our land. Our people's armed forces must be maintained
and developed with the heroic and steeled People's Liberation Army as the
foundation. We will have not only a powerful army but also a powerful air
force and a powerful navy.
<P>
Let the domestic and foreign reactionaries tremble before us! Let them say
we are no good at this and no good at that. By our own indomitable efforts
we the Chinese people will unswervingly reach our goal.
<P>
The heroes of the people who laid down their lives in the People's War of
Liberation and the people's revolution shall live for ever in our memory!
<P>
Hail the victory of the People's War of Liberation and the people's revolution!
<P>
Hail the founding of the People's Republic of China!
<P>
Hail the triumph of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!
