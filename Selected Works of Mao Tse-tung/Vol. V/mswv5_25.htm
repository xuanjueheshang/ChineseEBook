  CRITICIZE HAN CHAUVINISM

<P>
In some places the relations between nationalities are far from normal. For
Communists this is an intolerable situation. We must go to the root and criticize
the Han chauvinist ideas which exist to a serious degree among many Party
members and cadres, namely, the reactionary ideas of the landlord class and
the bourgeoisie, or the ideas characteristic of the Kuomintang, which are
manifested in the relations between nationalities. Mistakes in this respect
must be corrected at once. Delegations led by comrades who are familiar with
our nationality policy and full of sympathy for our minority nationality
compatriots still suffering from discrimination should be sent to visit the
areas where there are minority nationalities, make a serious effort at
investigation and study and help Party and government organizations in the
localities discover and solve problems. The visits should not be those of
"looking at flowers on horseback".
<P>
Judging from the mass of information on hand, the Central Committee holds
that wherever there are minority nationalities the general rule is that there
are problems calling for solution, and in some cases very serious ones. On
the surface all is quiet, but actually there are some very serious problems.
What has come to light in various places in the last two or three years shows
that Han chauvinism exists almost everywhere. It will be very dangerous if
we fail now to give timely education and resolutely overcome Han chauvinism
in the Party and among the people. The problem in the relations between
nationalities which reveals itself in the Party and among the people in many
places is the existence of Han chauvinism to a serious degree and not just
a matter of its vestiges. In other words, bourgeois ideas dominate the minds
of those comrades and people who have had no Marxist education and have not
grasped the nationality policy of the Central Committee. Therefore, education
must be assiduously carried out so that this problem can be solved step by
step. Moreover, the newspapers should publish more articles based on specific
facts to criticize Han chauvinism openly and educate the Party members and
the people. <A name="v5_26"></A>
