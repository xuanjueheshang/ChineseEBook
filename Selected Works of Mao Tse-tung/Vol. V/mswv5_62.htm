[Remarks by Comrade Mao Tsetung when he received the entire body of delegates
to the Third National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League of China.]

<P>
Your congress has been very successful. I hope you will unite and serve as
the core of leadership of the youth of China.
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party is the core of leadership of the whole Chinese
people. Without this core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious.
<P>
Your congress is a congress of unity and will exert a tremendous influence
on young people throughout China. I extend my congratulations to you.
<P>
Unite, comrades, and fight resolutely and courageously for the great cause
of socialism. Any word or deed at variance with socialism is completely wrong.
