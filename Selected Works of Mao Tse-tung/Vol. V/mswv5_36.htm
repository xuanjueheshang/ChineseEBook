  TWO TALKS ON MUTUAL AID AND CO-OPERATION IN AGRICULTURE
</h1><p><p class="title">
<EM>October and November 1953</EM>
<P class="information">
[Two talks to the responsible members of the Rural Work Department of the
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party before and during the Third
conference on Mutual Aid and Co-operation in Agriculture, which was convened
by the Central Committee and held from October 26 to November 5, 1953.] 
  <hr class="end" />

<h4><A name="v5_37">I. THE TALK OF OCTOBER 15</a></h4>
<p>Make a success of the agricultural producers' co-operatives and a big expansion
of the mutual-aid teams will follow.
<P>
In the new liberated areas every county, whether large, medium-sized or small,
should set up one or two successful co-operatives this winter and next spring
after full preparations; there should be at least one, on the average one
to two and at most three, depending on how well the work has been done. Quotas
should be allotted. To make the quota too big would mean rash advance and
to make it too small would be a Right deviation. To make the quota optional
would be to let things drift. Can there be more than three? So long as the
co-operatives meet the requirements, conform to the regulations and resolutions,
are set up on a voluntary basis, have strong leading cadres (their two chief
qualifications being fair-mindedness and competence) and are well run, then
the more the better, as Han Hsin said about the number of troops he could
command.[<A HREF="#bm1">1</A>]
The prefectural and county Party committees should be urged to make vigorous
efforts and do a good job. The rural work departments of the Central Committee
bureaus and of the provincial and municipal Party committees should keep
a firm grasp on this matter and make it the pivot of their work.
<P>
There should be control figures and an allotment of quotas. Allotment without
compulsion -- this is not commandism. After the October conference, there
are four or five months to go, that is, November and December this year,
January and February next year, and in the north the month of March as well.
We give clear notice now that early next year another meeting will be called
to check up on the work. There will definitely be a check-up then to see
how it is getting on.
<P>
Certain minority nationality areas where the agrarian reform has not been
completed can be exempted from setting up co-operatives. The small number
of poorly managed counties, for instance, counties where backward townships
account for 30 to 40 per cent of the total, where Party secretaries are
incompetent and where the work cannot start without leading to trouble, can
be exempted for the time being and given no quota. Nevertheless, the provincial
and prefectural Party committees should assume responsibility for helping
them to straighten things out and to create the conditions for starting the
work next winter after the autumn harvest.
<P>
The general pattern is to proceed from the mutual-aid team to the co-operative,
but it is also permissible to try and set up the co-operative directly. If
you take the direct path and succeed, that will speed up the work. So why
can't it be tried? It can.
<P>
The rural work departments at all levels should look upon mutual aid and
co-operation as a matter of vital importance. Peasants working on their own
cannot raise production to any great extent, therefore we must promote mutual
aid and co-operation. If socialism does not occupy the rural positions,
capitalism inevitably will. Is it possible to take any road other than the
capitalist or the socialist road? The capitalist road can also lead to increased
production, but the time required would be longer and the course painful.
We will not practice capitalism, that's settled. Yet capitalism is bound
to spread unchecked unless we go in for socialism.
<P>
The general line, the general programme, industrialization and socialist
transformation should be discussed at the forthcoming October conference.
<P>
Both "sustain private property" and the "four big
freedoms"<B>[<A HREF="#bm2">2</A>]</B> benefit the rich peasants and the
well-to-do middle peasants. Why then are there relevant stipulations in the
law? The law stipulates protection of private property, but the word "sustain"
is not in it. Some peasants are selling their land now, which is not good;
though the law does not prohibit it, we should make efforts to prevent them
from doing so. Setting up co-operatives is the solution. Mutual-aid teams
by themselves are not enough to stop peasants selling their land, only
co-operatives, and big ones at that, can do so. Moreover, big co-operatives
can eliminate the need of some peasants to rent out land, for a big co-operative
of one or two hundred households can solve the problem by taking in households
of widows, orphans and others not provided for. The question of whether small
co-operatives can likewise take in a few has to be studied. The mutual-aid
teams should also help widows, orphans and others not provided for. If you
can't set up a big co-operative, try a medium-sized one; if you can't set
up a medium-sized co-operative, try a small one. But go for a medium-sized
or big co-operative wherever possible, and don't be upset at the sight of
a big one. A co-operative of one or two hundred households can be counted
big, but a co-operative of even three or four hundred households is also
possible. Setting up several sub-co-operatives under a big co-operative is
an innovation, and it is by no means necessary to dissolve it. Running a
co-operative well does not mean bringing everything to perfection. Absorb
all kinds of experience, and don't impose the same pattern everywhere.
<P>
More co-operatives should be established in the old liberated areas. But
some new liberated areas may set up co-operatives at a faster tempo than
some old ones. For instance, the central Shensi plain may develop faster
than northern Shensi, the Chengtu plain faster than Fuping and other such
places. We must dispel the idea that the new liberated areas are destined
to go slow. In fact the Northeast is not an old liberated area, its southern
part not differing much from the new liberated areas south of the Great Wall.
Kiangsu and the Hangchow-Chiahsing-Huchow region will probably overtake the
mountainous old liberated areas in Shantung and North China, and so they
should. Generally speaking, the new liberated areas may be allowed more time
for their work, but in those places where the cadres are strong, the population
is dense and the terrain level, co-operatives are likely to grow fairly quickly
once a few models are set up.
<P>
There are now six thousand co-operatives in North China. If the figure is
to be doubled, quotas can be allotted straight away. If the figure is to
be tripled, those concerned should be consulted. We should allot quotas
reasonably and have control figures, otherwise we shall be working without
clear aims. The Northeast should increase its co-operatives by 100, 150 or
200 per cent, and so should North China The control figures should not be
too high, so that the localities may surpass them. Overfulfilment will greatly
enhance people's enthusiasm.
<P>
In developing co-operatives, we should strive for quantity, quality and economy.
By economy we mean no failures; failures are a waste of the peasants' energy,
with the bad end-result of losses both politically and in the production
of grain. Our final objective is to produce more grain, cotton, sugar-cane,
vegetables, and so on. There will be no way out unless grain production is
increased, otherwise neither the state nor the people will benefit.
<P>
Nor will there be a way out unless more vegetables are produced in the suburbs,
otherwise neither the state nor the people will benefit. Since the outlying
districts of the cities have rich soil and flat farmlands which moreover
are publicly owned, big co-operatives may be set up there first. Of course,
the work needs to be quite painstaking, and there is even less room for
sloppiness, because growing vegetables is different from growing grain. We
must set up pilot co-operatives and guard against rash advance.
<P>
To meet the urban demand for vegetables, we cannot rely on peasants working
on their own to bring their produce to the market. Ways must be worked out
at the production end as well as by the supply and marketing co-operatives.
As regards vegetables for the large cities, there is a big contradiction
between supply and demand at present.
<P>
There are also big contradictions between supply and demand in the cases
of grain and cotton, and others will soon emerge in the cases of meat, fats
and edible oils. Demand is growing fast and cannot be met.
<P>
To resolve the contradiction between supply and demand, it is necessary to
resolve the contradiction between ownership and the productive forces. Should
ownership be individual or collective? Capitalist ownership or socialist
ownership? Abundant supplies and the relations of production under individual
ownership are utterly incompatible with each other. There must be a transition
from individual ownership to collective ownership, to socialism. There are
elementary co-operatives where land is pooled as shares, and there are advanced
co-operatives in which land is owned in common, that is, by the co-operative.
<P>
In a sense the purpose of the general line is the solution of the<B>
</B>problem of ownership. State ownership is to be expanded by building new
state enterprises and renovating and enlarging old ones. The two kinds of
private ownership, that of the working people and that of the bourgeoisie,
are to be changed respectively into collective ownership and state ownership
(integration into socialism through joint state-private management). Only
thus can the productive forces be expanded and China's industrialization
accomplished. Only when the productive forces have developed can the
contradiction between supply and demand be resolved.
<h4><A name="v5_38">II. THE TALK OF NOVEMBER 4</a></h4>
<P>
Whatever we do must accord with reality, otherwise it is wrong. In order
to do what accords with reality we must consider what is imperative and what
is possible, and what is possible depends on political and economic conditions
and the cadre situation. At present, it is at once imperative and possible
to develop agricultural producers' co-operatives, for which there is a great
potential. Failure to tap this potential means to mark time and make no advance.
Our legs are for walking, and it is wrong to stand still all the time. It
is not right to force the dissolution of co-operatives which meet the
requirements, this is wrong no matter what the circumstances. The campaign
to "check impetuosity and rash advance" was a gust of wind, wasn't it? As
it blew from above, it brought down a number of agricultural producers'
co-operatives that should have survived. An investigation should be made
about such co-operatives, the findings made known and the mistake admitted,
otherwise the township cadres and activists in those places will have pent-up
grievances.
<P>
We must work for socialism. "Sustain private property" is a bourgeois concept.
"To be together all day long and never talk about fundamentals but take pleasure
only in giving small favours -- indeed it's a hopeless case!" "Never talk
about fundamentals" means never talking about socialism, never working for
socialism. Agricultural credits, relief grain, taxation according to fixed
rates, tax reduction and exemption according to law, small-scale water
conservancy projects, wells and canals, deep ploughing and close planting,
proper application of fertilizer, popularization of new-type walking ploughs,
water-wheels, sprayers, insecticides, etc. -- all these things are fine.
But to do all this on the basis of the small peasant economy instead of by
relying on socialism is to give the peasants small favours. Once these fine
things are linked to the general line and to socialism, the case will be
different, and they will no longer be small favours. We must work for socialism
and link these fine things with it. As for "sustain private property" and
the "four big freedoms", there is all the more reason to call them small
favours, and besides, they are favours to the rich and well-to-do middle
peasants. To lay one's hopes for greatly increased grain production and for
a solution of the food problem and of the all-important problem of the nation's
economy and the people's livelihood not on socialism but on making much of
the small peasant economy and on giving small favours on the basis of the
individual economy -- "indeed it's a hopeless case"!
<P>
As an old saying goes, "Once the headrope of a fishing net is pulled up,
all its meshes open." It is only by taking hold of the key link the everything
else will fall into its proper place. The key link means the main theme.
The contradiction between socialism and capitalism an the gradual resolution
of this contradiction -- that is the main theme, the key link. Grasp this
key link, and all kinds of political and economic work to help the peasants
will fall under it.
<P>
There are contradictions both inside and outside the agricultural producers'
co-operatives. The present co-operatives are semi-socialist whereas peasants
working on their own outside the co-operatives are entirely under the system
of private ownership. Hence there is a contradiction between the two. The
mutual-aid teams are different from the agricultural producers' co-operatives
in that the former engage only in collective labour and do not affect ownership.
The present-day co-operatives are built on the basis of private ownership,
with privately owned land, draught animals and large farm implements pooled
as shares. Hence there is also a contradiction inside the co-operative between
the socialist factors and private ownership, a contradiction which must gradually
be resolved. In the future, when our present-day semi-public, semi-private
ownership advances to collective ownership this contradiction will be resolved.
We are taking steady steps, moving first from mutual-aid teams which contain
rudiments of socialism to semi-socialist and later to fully socialist
co-operatives (which we still call agricultural producers' co-operatives,
not collective farms). Generally speaking, the mutual-aid teams remain the
foundation of the agriculture producers' co-operatives.
<P>
At one time, no mention was made of mutual aid and co-operation in several
of our documents, and to all of them I added words to the effect that mutual
aid and co-operation were to be developed or the necessary and feasible political
and economic work was to be done. Some people wanted to make much of the
small peasant economy, an this was why they concentrated on opposing excessive
meddling with the peasants. True, there was some excessive meddling at that
time. The "five excesses" from higher up were rammed through various channels
down to the lower levels, causing a lot of trouble. The "five excesses" should
never be tolerated, whether in the villages, factories or army units. The
Central Committee has issued several documents to combat excessive meddling,
and this has done some good. What is meant by excessive meddling? Drawing
up subjective plans at variance with reality and regardless of what is imperative
and possible, or carrying out plans, even realistic ones, by means of commandism.
Subjectivism and commandism are always bad and will be so even ten thousand
years hence. They are bad for the scattered small peasant economy and no
less so for the co-operatives. But to do what is both imperative and possible
and moreover do it by means other than commandism -- this cannot be called
excessive meddling. The above ought to be the yardstick when reviewing our
work. Whatever is subjectivist and unrealistic is wrong. Whatever is done
through commandism is likewise wrong. To mark time and make no advance is
a deviation to the Right; to go beyond what is practicable is a deviation
to the "Left". Both are manifestations of subjectivism. Rash advance is wrong,
failure to set up co-operatives when they can be set up is also wrong, and
forcible dissolution of co-operatives even worse.
<P>
"Life is hard in the villages, all is not well and the measures adopted do
not suit the small peasant economy." Such complaints exist inside as well
as outside the Party. True, life is a bit hard in the villages, but we ought
to make a proper analysis. In fact, life is not all that hard, the
grain-deficient households account for only 10 per cent or so, and half of
them are those of widows, orphans and other people without a provider, who
are in great difficulty for lack of labour-power, but the mutual-aid teams
and the co-operatives can give them some help. After all, things are much
better for them than in Kuomintang days, and land has been distributed to
them. Life is indeed hard for people in areas stricken by natural calamities,
but they have received relief grain. The life of the peasants in general
is good and is getting better; that is why 80 to 90 per cent of them feel
happy and support the government. About 7 per cent of the rural population,
the landlords and rich peasants, are dissatisfied with the government. "Life
is hard in the villages, and things are terrible there" -- certainly this
has not been my view. Some people speak of the scattered nature as well as
the hardships of the villages, that is, the scattered nature of the small
peasant economy; but in doing so, they fail to mention forming co-operatives.
To carry out the socialist transformation of the individual economy, to promote
mutual aid and co-operation and to set up co-operatives -- this is not merely
the direction to take but the immediate task before us.
<P>
But for the Conference on Financial and Economic Work held in July and August,
the question of the general line would have remained unsettled for many comrades.
The aim of that conference was mainly to settle this question. We criticized
Po I-po precisely for his mistake in departing from the general line. In
short, the general line means the gradual accomplishment of the socialist
industrialization of our country and of the socialist transformation of
agriculture, handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce. The planned
purchase and supply of grain recently put into effect has given a big impetus
to socialism. The present Conference on Mutual Aid and Co-operation, coming
shortly after as it does, will give it another big impetus. In view of the
fact that the campaign for mutual aid and co-operation has been held back
for the better part of this year, the present conference should be more active
in this respect. But our policies must be made clear. It is very important
to make our policies known.
<P>
"Active leadership and steady development" -- this is well put. The campaign
has been held back for the better part of this year and has marked time without
making any advance. This is not quite right. However, there is a positive
side to it. It is like fighting battles. After each battle there should be
time for rest and consolidation before starting the next. The trouble is
that in some places too many of our positions have been given up, while in
others it has not been a matter of giving up too many positions but failure
to develop where development was possible and failure to allow any development
or give it approval so that it became illegal. In this world it often happens
that many new-born things which are correct are considered illegal. We ourselves
were "illegal" in the past while the Kuomintang was "legal". But these illegal
co-operatives have held on to this day and are doing quite well. Can you
still withhold recognition? You have to admit that they are legal, after
all they have won out.
<P>
The conference has discussed active leadership and steady development, but
you should anticipate some troubles. You may talk about being active and
steady, and yet in practice you may fail to give active leadership or achieve
steady development. Being active and steady entails setting control figures,
assigning tasks and then checking whether they are fulfilled. Failure to
fulfil what can be fulfilled is impermissible, it shows a lack of enthusiasm
for socialism. According to the findings of our check-up, 5 to 10 per cent
of the co-operatives have shown a drop in output and are not doing so well.
This is due to lack of active leadership. Of course, it is inevitable that
a few co-operatives should show a fall in production because of poor management.
However, if 20 per cent of the co-operatives, or even more, were to show
a fall in production, that would be quite a problem.
<P>
The general line means a gradual change in the relations of production. According
to Stalin, the system of ownership is the basis of the relations of
production.<B>[<A HREF="#bm3">3</A>]</B> Comrades must have a clear understanding
of this point. At present, both private ownership and socialist public ownership
are legal, but private ownership will gradually become illegal. To "sustain
private ownership" of three <EM>mou</EM> of land and practice the "four big
freedoms" is to facilitate the growth of a small number of rich peasants
and follow the capitalist road.
<P>
County and district cadres must gradually switch their work to mutual aid
and co-operation in agricultural production, to the promotion of socialism.
If they are not working for socialism, what are they working for? For the
individual economy? Secretaries of county and district Party committees must
look upon working for socialism as a matter of major importance. Party
secretaries must take charge, and I am the secretary of the Central Committee.
Secretaries of the Central Committee bureaus, secretaries of the provincial,
prefectural, county and district Party committees and secretaries at all
levels must take charge and attend to the job in person. At present, the
Central Committee is devoting 70 to 80 per cent of its efforts to the socialist
transformation of agriculture. Similarly, to transform capitalist industry
and commerce is also to work for socialism. Comrades of the rural work
departments at all levels and all those present at this conference must become
experts in the socialist transformation of agriculture and well versed in
theory, line, policy and method.
<P>
To provide the cities with vegetables depends chiefly on planned supply.
There are dense populations in the large and rising cities, and how can they
possibly manage without vegetables? This problem must be solved. If it is
not possible to ensure the production and supply of vegetables by setting
up mutual-aid teams in the suburban areas, you can bypass that stage and
set up semi-socialist or even fully socialist co-operatives. This question
needs going into.
<P>
A plan for the development of the producers' co-operatives has been put forward.
Over 32,000 co-operatives are to be set up this winter and next spring and
right up to the time of the autumn harvest. By 1957, the number will have
reached 700,000. But a sudden increase at one time or another should be expected,
and the number of co-operatives may rise to a million, or perhaps more. In
short, set up co-operatives in large numbers and manage them well, give active
leadership and achieve steady development.
<P>
This conference has been fruitful. If we had not held it and waited till
next January, it would have been too late, and this winter would have slipped
by. We shall hold another conference on March 26 next year and check up on
how our plan has been carried out. It is a good idea for this conference
to fix the date of the next meeting and to decide that it will review the
implementation of the resolution adopted here. Next autumn we shall hold
still another conference to discuss and decide on the tasks for the following
winter.
