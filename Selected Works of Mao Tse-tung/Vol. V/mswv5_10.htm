<P>
To leading comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers at all levels:
<P>
1. In order to support the Korean people's war of liberation and to resist
the attacks of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, thereby safeguarding
the interests of the people of Korea, China and all the other countries in
the East, I herewith order the Chinese People's Volunteers to march speedily
to Korea and join the Korean comrades in fighting the aggressors and winning
a glorious victory.
<P>
2. While in Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers must show fraternal feelings
and respect for the people, the People's Army, the Democratic Government,
the Workers' Party and the other democratic parties of Korea as well as for
Comrade Kim Il Sung, the leader of the Korean people, and strictly observe
military and political discipline. This is a most important political basis
for ensuring the fulfilment of your military task.
<P>
3. You must fully anticipate various possible and inevitable difficulties
and be prepared to overcome them with great enthusiasm, courage, care and
stamina. At present, the international and domestic situation as a whole
is favourable to us, not to the aggressors. So long as you comrades are firm
and brave and are good at uniting with the people there and at fighting the
aggressors, final victory will be ours.
