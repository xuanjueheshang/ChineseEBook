<P>
The Chinese and Korean comrades should unite as closely as brothers, go through
thick and thin together, stick together in life and death and fight to the
end to defeat their common enemy. The Chinese comrades must consider Korea's
cause as their own and the commanders and fighters must be instructed to
cherish every hill, every river, every tree and every blade of grass in Korea
and take not a single needle or a single thread from the Korean people, just
the way we feel about our own country and treat our own people. This is the
political basis for winning victory. So long as we act this way, final victory
will be assured. <A name="v5_12"> </A>
