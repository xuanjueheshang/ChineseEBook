The present-day capitalist economy in China is a capitalist economy which
for the most part is under the control of the People's Government and which
is linked with the state-owned socialist economy in various forms and supervised
by the workers. It is not an ordinary but a particular kind of capitalist
economy, namely, a state-capitalist economy of a new type. It exists not
chiefly to make profits for the capitalists but to meet the needs of the
people and the state. True, a share of the profits produced by the workers
goes to the capitalists, but that is only a small part, about one quarter,
of the total. The remaining three quarters are produced for the workers (in
the form of the welfare fund), for the state (in the form of income tax)
and for expanding productive capacity (a small part of which produces profits
for the capitalists). Therefore, this state-capitalist economy of a new type
takes on a socialist character to a very great extent and benefits the workers
and the state. <A name="v5_31"></A>
