<p>
We are deeply grateful for your message of congratulations to the People's
Republic of China. The people of China are deeply aware that their own triumph
depends on the assistance given it by the international workers' movement
and will strive to consolidate their mutual concern and immortal friendship
with the laboring peoples of all countries of the world.
