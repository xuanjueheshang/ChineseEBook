<h1>
 Note to the Reader
</h1>

<p>
We are glad to bring out another compilation of the writings of Mao
Tse-tung.&nbsp;
<p>
This volume covers the period 1949 to 1957.
<p>
We request the reader to note that "(Excerpt)" below a title indicates that
the document was excerpted from a larger document by the original publisher
(Source) [See for example the article "Speech at Banquet Commemorating the
Liberation of Romania" p.90] and wherever the excerpting was done by others,
from a larger document presenting more interesting or significant portions
of the original, the title is followed by "[Excerpts]" (see for example the
article "Conversation with Zhai Zuojun" p. 166). As a rule parentheses (
) indicates editorial remarks in the original, whereas brackets [ ] enclose
the editorial remarks of the editors of those texts (other than the editors
of the original source).
<p>
We once again extend our sincere thanks and acknowledgments to all those
pioneers who translated, edited and published these works in different forms
earlier. We whole heartedly extend our thanks to all these comrades
&#8212; the respected scholars and loving friends
&#8212; whose unstinted cooperation and painstaking
efforts contributed in a big way in the success of this venture.
<p>
We hope to bring out some more volumes in the near future. It is our fond
hope that our effort will be well rewarded by the warm and enthusiastic response
of the esteemed readers.
