  Comment on Class Education with Leaders from Shanghai Motor Power Institute

We must strengthen ideological and political work for youth; we must teach
them not to despise labour so that they will be able to construct our nation
successfully! Even if the youth is a young worker, because he has not undergone
the hardship of the old society it is all the more necessary to strengthen
class education in order to enhance his ideological awareness.
