<p class="information">
The book <em>Vitezstivi nove Demokraicie v Cine</em> (<em>The Victory of New Democracy
in China</em>)<em> </em>was compiled by the editorial board of the Czechoslovakian
monthly <em>Mezinarodni Politika</em> (<em>International Politics</em>) and published
in the Prague on October 25, 1949. The book was edited and published under
the direction of the Central Secretariat of the Communist Party of
Czechoslovakia.

The Comrades of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia have published in the
Czech language the documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference and my own essay concerning the people's democratic dictatorship
of China. That is a great honor for the Communist Party of China. The struggles
of the people of China and the peoples of Europe are two inseparable and
mutually reinforcing parts of a common cause, despite the fact that owing
to the differences in the levels of social development the stages of the
development of their revolutions are different. All the readers of Europe
who are concerned about the destiny of Asia will gain a basic knowledge of
New China from reading these short documents and particularly from reading
the Sixty Article Common Program passed by the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference. I believe that the effort which our comrades in
Czechoslovakia have exerted in helping European readers to understand New
China is a contribution to the international revolutionary movement for which
we must be grateful.
