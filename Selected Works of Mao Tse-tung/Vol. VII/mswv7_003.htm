The people throughout China have been plunged into bitter suffering and
tribulations since the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionary government
betrayed the fatherland, colluded with imperialists, and lunched the
counter-revolutionary war. Fortunately our People's Liberation Army, backed
by the whole nation, has been fighting heroically and selflessly to defend
the territorial sovereignty of our homeland, to protect the people's lives
and property, to relieve the people of their sufferings, and to struggle
for their rights, and it eventually wiped out the reactionary troops and
overthrew the reactionary rule of the Nationalist government. Now, the People's
War of Liberation has been basically won, and the majority of the people
in the country have been liberated. On this foundation, the first session
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference , composed of delegates
of all the democratic parties and people's organization of China, the People's
Liberation Army, the various regions and nationalities of the country, and
the overseas Chinese and other patriotic elements, has been convened.
