Chairman Mao pointed out first of all that the October Socialist Revolution
marks a turning point in world history; the appearance in the heavens of
two artificial satellites and the coming to Moscow of delegates from the
sixty-four communist and works' parties to celebrate the holiday of the October
Revolution mark a new turning point. The forces of socialism surpass the
forces of imperialism. The imperialist forces have a leader, America; our
socialist camp must also have a leader, and that leader the Soviet Union.
If we do not have a leader our forces might disintegrate! Chairman Mao...
said it was an event of great significance that the communist and workers'
parties of sixty-four countries attended the celebrations of the fortieth
anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. It showed the solidarity
of the socialist countries, let by the Soviet Union. It showed the solidarity
of the communists and workers' parties the world over, with the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union as their center. Chairman Mao said that the direction
of the wind in the world had changed. In the struggle between the socialist
and capitalist camps, it was no longer the west wind that prevailed over
the East wind, but the East wind that prevailed over the West wind. The world
now has a population of 2.7 million, the countries now struggling for
independence or for complete independence plus the capitalist countries with
neutralist tendencies 600 million, and the imperialist camp only about 400
million, besides which they are also divided internally. Earth quakes are
likely to occur over there. At present, Chairman Mao said, it was not the
west wind that was prevailing over the East wind, but the east wind prevailing
over the west wind.
