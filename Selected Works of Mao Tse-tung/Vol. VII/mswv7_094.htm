Mr. Ambassador:
<p>
&nbsp;
<p>
I am very glad to accept the letter of credence from the President of the
Republic of India that Your Excellency has presented and am grateful for
Your Excellency's congratulations.
<p>
For more than two years, the friendly relations between China and India in
the areas of economy and culture have further developed. I believe that the
friendly cooperation between our two peoples will be further enhanced and
consolidated in our common cause of pursuing peace in Asia and throughout
the world.
<p>
I warmly welcome Your Excellency as the ambassador plenipotentiary and
extraordinary of the Republic of India to the People's Republic of China
and pledge to Your Excellency assistance in your work of strengthening the
friendly cooperation between our two countries.
<p>
Best wishes for the prosperity of your country, the prospering of your people,
and the good health of your head of state.
