<p>
Comrade Shvernik:
<p>
It was with boundless grief that the Chinese people, the Chinese government,
and I myself learned the news of the passing away of the Chinese people's
closest friend and great teacher, Comrade Stalin. This is an inestimable
loss, not only for the people of the Soviet Union, but for the Chinese people,
for the entire camp of peace and democracy, and for peace-loving people
throughout the world. On behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese government,
and on my own behalf, I extend to you and to the people and government of
the Soviet Union our deepest condolences.
<p>
The victory of the Chinese people's revolution is absolutely in separable
from Comrade Stalin's unceasing care, leadership, and support of over thirty
years. Since the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, Comrade Stalin
and the people and government of the Soviet Union, under his leadership have
rendered generous and selfless assistance to the Chinese people's cause of
construction. Such a great and profound friendship as that which comrade
Stalin had for the Chinese people will be forever remembered with gratitude
by the Chinese people. The immortal beacon of Comrade Stalin will forever
illuminate the path on which the Chinese people march forward.
<p>
Comrade Chairman, the glorious party of Lenin and Stalin and the great people
and government of the Soviet Union will certainly have the brotherly confidence
and support of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people, and the
Chinese government. With the greatest resolve, the Chinese people definitely
will always and closely unite as one with the great Soviet people to consolidate
and strengthen the world camp for peace and democracy headed by the Soviet
Union, heighten their vigilance, redouble their efforts, strike at the
provocateurs of war, and strive to the end for the lasting interest of the
Soviet and Chinese peoples and of world peace and security. I believe that
the laboring people and all progressive peace-loving people of the world
will take the same path as we do, following the direction pointed out by
Comrade Stalin, and take up the sacred cause of protecting world peace.
