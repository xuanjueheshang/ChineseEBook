The President,
<p>
The German Democratic Republic
<p>
&nbsp;
<p>
Comrade Pieck:
<p>
On behalf of the Chinese people, the government of the People's Republic
of China, and on my own behalf, I sincerely extend to you and to the people
and government of the German Democratic Republic our heartfelt congratulations
on this occasion of the third anniversary of the founding of the German
Democratic Republic.
<p>
In their struggles to secure a peace treaty and to restore the unity of Germany,
to develop the economy and culture, and to consolidate state power, the victories
scored by the German people have had a tremendous effect on the prosperity
and happiness of the German people and the cause of peace throughout the
world. Our best wishes to the German people for securing even greater successes
in the struggle they have undertaken to build a unified, peaceful, democratic,
and socialist Germany.
<p>
