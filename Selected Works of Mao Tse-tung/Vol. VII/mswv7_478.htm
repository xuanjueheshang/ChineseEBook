Dear Comrades Khrushchov, Voroshilov, and Bulganin:
<p>
Dear Comrades and Friends:
<p>
The anniversary of the October Revolution is a great festival of victory
for the Soviet People and for the proletariat, the laboring masses, and all
oppressed peoples of the world. The victory won by the Soviet people under
the leadership of the great Lenin and the great Communist Party of the Soviet
Union forty years ago initiated a new epoch in human history. In the process
of forty years of construction, the Soviet Union has made brilliant achievements
at an extraordinary speed and in many fields has advanced to the forefront
of the countries of the world, thus setting an outstanding example for the
peoples who are striving for progress and happiness. The launching of the
first man-made earth satellite by the Soviet Union is no simple feat. It
Marks the beginning of a new era of man's further conquest of nature.
<p>
The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is a strong bulwark ensuring
world peace and a faithful friend to all peoples who refuse to suffer imperialist
oppression and enslavement...
<p>
The October Revolution enabled the Chinese people to find the way to
emancipation, prosperity, wealth, and power [<em>fu ch'iang</em>]. In their
own cause, the Chinese people have received tremendous sympathy and generous
assistance from the people of the Soviet Union. The Peoples of our two countries
have already formed fraternal alliance in their common struggles and there
no is force on earth which can separate us.
<p>
Comrades, we will stand together forever, fighting for world peace and for
the victory of our common cause!
<p>
&nbsp;
<p>
Glory To The Great October Socialist Revolution!
<p>
Glory To The Great Soviet People And To The Great Communist Party Of The
Soviet Union!
<p>
Long Live The Great Friendship Between The Chinese And Soviet Peoples!
<p>
Long Live World Peace!
