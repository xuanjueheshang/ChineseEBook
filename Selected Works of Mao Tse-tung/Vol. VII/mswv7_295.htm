Chairman,

The Council of Ministers,
<p>
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republic,

<p>
Dear Comrade J. V. Stalin:
<p>
On learning the unfortunate news that you have come down with a severe illness,
the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and myself, bearing feelings
of deepest concern, extend to you our sincere sympathy and wish with all
our hearts that your condition will take a turn for the better, that you
will be restored to health, and that the prayers of the peace-loving people
of China and of the whole world may be answered.
<p>
