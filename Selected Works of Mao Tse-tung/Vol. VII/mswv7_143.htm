  Comment on Hearing of Mao Anying's Death

<p><p>"In war there must be sacrifice. Without sacrifices there will be no victory.
To sacrifice my son or other people's sons are just the same. There are no
parents in the world who do not treasure their children. But please do not
feel sad on my behalf, because this is something entirely
unpredictable".<B>[<A HREF="#bm2">2</a>]</B>
<p>

<p>We understand the how&#146;s and whys of these things. There are so many
common folk whose children have shed their blood and were sacrificed for
the sake of the revolution. They are in need of consolation, and we ought
to pay more attention to showing them greater
concern.<B>[<A HREF="#bm3">3</a>]</B>
