Mr. Shuqing:<B>[<A HREF="#bm1">1</a>]</B>
<p>
Your gracious letter has been receipt. I am very grateful for your conveying
to me news of our home village. As for matters related to the localities,
I wish only to collect material and information for reference purpose; I
do not want to, and should not, directly handle local problems in general
[because this would] make it difficult for the local Party and government
[organs] to handle their affairs. Please understand my situation and forgive
me.
<p>
With great respect,
<p>
