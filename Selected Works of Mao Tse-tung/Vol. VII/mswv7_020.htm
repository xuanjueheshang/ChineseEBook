Captain Fang Linliu and all comrades onboard the ship "Hailiao"
<p>
Congratulations on your insurrection on the seas and on your success in bringing
the "Hailiao" to our port in the Northeast. For the sake of the people's
state you have united together, overcome difficulties, and left the side
of the reactionaries to stand on the side of the people. The action is applauded
by the people of the entire country and should be emulated by all captains
and crews who are still under the control of the Kuomintang reactionaries
and bureaucratic capitalism.&nbsp;
