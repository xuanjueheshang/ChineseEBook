Dear comrades and friends:
<p>
I am genuinely pleased to have the chance to join this distinguished gathering
in celebration of the seventieth birthday of Comrade Stalin.
<p>
Comrade Stalin is a teacher and friend of the people of the world as well
as a teacher and friend of the Chinese people. He has further developed the
revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism and has made extremely outstanding
and extensive contributions to the cause of world Communist movement. In
the arduous struggle to resist their oppressors, the Chinese people have
become deeply appreciative of the importance of Comrade Stalin's friendship.
<p>
At this distinguished gathering, on behalf of the Chinese people and the
Communist Party of China, I congratulate Comrade Stalin on his seventieth
birthday and wish him health and longevity. We wish well- being, strength,
and prosperity to our great friend, the Soviet Union under the leadership
of Comrade Stalin. We hail the great unprecedented solidarity of the working
class in the world under the leadership of Comrade Stalin.
<p>
Long live the great Stalin, leader of the world's working class and of the
international Communist movement!
<p>
Long live the Soviet Union, the stronghold of world peace and democracy!
<p>
