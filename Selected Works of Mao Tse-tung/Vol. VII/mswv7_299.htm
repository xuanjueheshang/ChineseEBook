Comrade Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the greatest genius of the present
age, the great teacher of the world Communist movement, and the comrade-in-arms
of the immortal Lenin, has departed from the world.
<p>
Comrade Stalin's contribution to our era through his theoretical activities
and practice is incalculable. Comrade Stalin represented our entire new age.
His activities have let the Soviet people and the working people of all countries
to turn around the whole world situation. That is to say, the cause of justice
and of People's Democracy and socialism has achieved victory in an immense
region of the world, a region embracing more than 800 million people
&#8212; one third of the earth's population. Moreover,
the influence of this victory is daily spreading to every corner of the world.
<p>
The death of Comrade Stalin has caused the laboring people of the whole world
to feel unparalleled and profound grief; it has stirred the hearts of just
people throughout the world. This demonstrates that Comrade Stalin's cause
and his thought have gripped the broad masses of the people throughout the
world and have already become an invincible force, a force that will guide
those people who have already achieved victory in achieving still more fresh
victories, one after another, and, at the same time, will guide all those
people who are still groaning under the oppression of the evil old world
of capitalism so that they can strike courageously at the enemies of the
people.&nbsp;
<p>
After the death of Lenin, Comrade Stalin led the Soviet people in building
into a magnificent socialist society the first socialist state in the world,
which he, together with the great Lenin, created at the time of the October
Revolution. The victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union was
not only a victory for the people of the Soviet Union, but also a common
victory for the people of the whole world. First, this victory proved in
the most real ( live terms the infinite correctness of Marxism-Leninism and
concretely educated working people through out the world on how they should
advance toward a good life. Second, this victory ensured that during the
Second World War humanity would have the strength to defeat the Fascist beast.
The achievement of victory in the anti-Fascist war, and the glory for these
victories should be attributed to our great Comrade Stalin.
<p>
Comrade Stalin developed Marxist-Leninist theory in a comprehensive and
epoch-making way and propelled the development of Marxism to a new stage.
Comrade Stalin creatively developed Lenin's theory concerning the law of
the uneven development of capitalism and the theory that it is possible for
socialism to first achieve victory in one country; Comrade Stalin creatively
contributed the theory of the general crisis of the capitalist system.; he
contributed the theory concerning the building of communism in the Soviet
Union; he contributed the theory of the fundamental economic laws of present-day
capitalism and of socialism; he contributed the theory of revolution in colonies
and semi-colonies. Comrade Stalin also creatively developed Lenin's theory
of party building. All these creative theories of Comrade Stalin's further
united the workers throughout the world, further united the oppressed classes
and oppressed people throughout the world, thereby enabling the struggle
of the world's working class and all oppressed people for liberation and
well-being and the victories in this struggle to reach unprecedented proportions.
<p>
All of Comrade Stalin's writing are immortal documents of Marxism. His works,
The Foundations of Leninism, The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union [Bolshevik], and his last great work, Economic Problems of Socialism
in the USSR, constitute an encyclopedia of Marxism-Leninism, a synthesis
of the experience of the world Communist movement of the past hundred years.
His speech at the Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union is a precious last testament bequeathed to the Communists of all the
countries of the world. We Chinese Communists, like the Communists of all
countries, search for our own road to victory in the great works of Comrade
Stalin.
<p>
Since the death of Lenin, Comrade Stalin has always been the central figure
in the world Communist movement. We rallied around him, constantly asked
his advice, and constantly drew ideological strength from his works. Comrade
Stalin was full of warmth for the oppressed peoples of the East. "Do not
forget the East" ( this was Comrade Stalin's great call after the October
Revolution. Everyone knows that Comrade Stalin warmly loved the Chinese people
and regarded the might of the Chinese revolution as incalculable. On the
question of the Chinese revolution, he contributed his exalted wisdom. It
was by following the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, along with having the
support of the great Soviet state and all the revolutionary forces of other
countries, that the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people achieved
their historic victory a few years ago.
<p>
Now we have lost our great teacher and most sincere friend Comrade Stalin.
What a misfortune this is! The sorrow that this misfortune has brought us
cannot be described in words.
<p>
Our task is to transform sorrow into strength. In memory of our great teacher
Stalin, the great friendship between the Communist Party of China and the
Chinese people [on the one hand] and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
and the Soviet People [on the other] formed in the name of Stalin will never
cease to be strengthened. The Chinese Communists and the Chinese people will
further intensify the study of Stalin's teachings and the study of Soviet
science and technology in order to build our country.
<p>
The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a party nurtured personally by
Lenin and Stalin; it is the most advanced, the most experienced, and the
most theoretically cultivated party in the world. This party has been our
model in the past, is our model at present, and will still be our model in
the future. We fully believe that the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union and the government of the Soviet Union headed by
Comrade Malenkov will definitely be able to carry on Comrade Stalin's unfinished
work and push the great cause of Communism forward and carry it to greater
and more glorious development.
<p>
There is not the slightest doubt that the camp of world peace, democracy,
and socialism headed by the Soviet Union will become even more united and
even more powerful.
<p>
In the past thirty years, Comrade Stalin's teachings and the model of the
construction of socialism in the Soviet Union have facilitated a major step
forward for the world. Now that the Soviet Union has become so powerful the
Chinese people's revolution has achieved such great victories, construction
in the various people's democracies has achieved such great success, the
movement of the peoples of various countries throughout the world against
oppression and aggression has risen to such heights, and our front of friendship
and solidarity is so consolidated, we can say with complete certainty that
we are not afraid of any imperialist aggression. Any imperialist aggression
will be smashed by us, and all their despicable provocation will be to no
avail.
<p>
The reason that the great friendship between the peoples of the two countries,
China and the Soviet Union, is unbreakable is that our friendship has been
built on the great principles of the internationalism of Marx, Engels, Lenin
and Stalin. The friendship between the peoples of the two countries, China
and the Soviet Union, and the peoples of the various people's democracies,
as well as with all the people who love peace, democracy, and justice in
all the countries of the world is also built upon these great principles
of internationalism and consequently is also unbreakable.
<p>
Clearly, the strength created by this kind of friendship of ours is inexhaustible
and truly invincible.
<p>
Let all imperialist aggressors and warmongers tremble before our great
friendship!
<p>
Long live the teaching of Marx, Lenin and Stalin!
<p>
Immortal glory to the heroic name of the great Stalin!
