Mr. Niantian:<B>[<A HREF="#bm1">1</a>]</B>

<p>
Your gracious letter and the poetry of Mr. Huang
Jigang <B>[<A HREF="#bm2">2</a>]</B>
as well as your own writings have been received, and I am very grateful to
you. I am very gratified by the fact that you have devoted yourself to scholarly
improvement and to serving the people in the cause of education. You have
my great veneration for that. I hope that you will continue to apply yourself
to the task and that with each day's passing improvements will come and results
will be achieved. That, indeed, is our fervent hope.
