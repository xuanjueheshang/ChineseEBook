</h1>
<p class="information">[Source:<em> People's Daily,</em> February 23, 1953.]

<p class="information">
On February 22, 1953, a delegation of the PRC government headed by Premier
Zhou Enlai, visited the Soviet Union's troops stationed in the Lushan region
pursuant to the Sino-Soviet agreement on the joint administration of the
region, which was a corollary agreement of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship,
Alliance, and Mutual Assistance signed on February 14, 1950. The delegation
celebrated the thirty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Union's
armed forces with the Soviet troops in Lushun-Dalian. Mao's inscription was
embroidered on a banner which was awarded by the delegation to the Soviet
troops.

<p>
The intimate unity between the two great
peoples &#8212; the Soviet People and the Chinese
People &#8212; and between their armed forces is
a reliable safeguard for peace in the Far East and in the world.
